Castro-Huerta certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of oklahoma No. 21429.Argued April 27, 2022Decided June 29, 2022 In 2015, respondent Victor Manuel Castro-Huerta was charged by the State of Oklahoma for child neglect.  Castro-Huerta was convicted in state court and sentenced to 35 years of imprisonment.  While Castro-Huertas state-court appeal was pending, this Court decided McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U.S. ___.  There, the Court held that the Creek Nations reservation in eastern Oklahoma had never been properly disestablished and therefore remained Indian country.  Id., at ___.  In light of McGirt, the eastern part of Oklahoma, including Tulsa, is recognized as Indian country.  Following this development, Castro-Huerta argued that the Federal Government had exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute him (a non-Indian) for a crime committed against his stepdaughter (a Cherokee Indian) in Tulsa (Indian country), and that the State therefore lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him.  The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals agreed and vacated his conviction.  This Court granted certiorari to determine the extent of a States jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. Held:The Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  Pp.425. (a)The jurisdictional dispute in this case arises because Oklahomas territory includes Indian country.  In the early Republic, the Federal Government sometimes treated Indian country as separate from state territory.  See Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515.  But that view has long since been abandoned. Organized Village of Kake v. Egan,\\n369 U.S. 60, 72.  And the Court has specifically held that States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against non-Indians in Indian country.  United States v. McBratney,\\n104 U.S. 621; see also Draper v. United States,\\n164 U.S. 240, 244247.  Accordingly, States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in Indian country unless preempted.  Pp.46.   (b)Under Court precedent, a States jurisdiction in Indian country may be preempted by federal law under ordinary principles of federal preemption, or when the exercise of state jurisdiction would unlawfully infringe on tribal self-government.  Neither serves to preempt state jurisdiction in this case.  Pp.620. (1)Castro-Huerta points to two federal lawsthe General Crimes Act and Public Law 280that, in his view, preempt Oklahomas authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  Neither statute, however, preempts the States jurisdiction.  Pp.718. (i)The General Crimes Act does not preempt state authority to prosecute Castro-Huertas crime.  It provides that the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed ... within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States ... shall extend to the Indian country.\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1152.  By its terms, the Act simply extend[s] the federal laws that apply on federal enclaves to Indian country.  The Act does not say that Indian country is equivalent to a federal enclave for jurisdictional purposes, that federal jurisdiction is exclusive in Indian country, or that state jurisdiction is preempted in Indian country. Castro-Huerta claims that the General Crimes Act does indeed make Indian country the jurisdictional equivalent of a federal enclave.  Castro-Huerta is wrong as a matter of text and precedent. Pointing to the history of territorial separation and Congresss reenactment of the General Crimes Act after this Court suggested in dicta in Williams v. United States,\\n327 U.S. 711, 714, that States lack jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country, Castro-Huerta argues that Congress implicitly intended for the Act to provide the Federal Government with exclusive jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  But the text of the Act says no such thing; the idea of territorial separation has long since been abandoned; and the reenactment canon cannot be invoked to override clear statutory language of the kind present in the General Crimes Act.  Castro-Huerta notes that the Court has repeated the Williams dicta on subsequent occasions, but even repeated dicta does not constitute precedent and does not alter the plain text of the General Crimes Act.  Pp.716. (ii)Castro-Huertas attempt to invoke Public Law 280,\\n\\n67Stat.\\n588, is also unpersuasive.  That law affirmatively grants certain States (and allows other States to acquire) broad jurisdiction to prosecute state-law offenses committed by or against Indians in Indian country.  \\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1162;\\n\\n25 U.S.C. 1321.  Castro-Huerta contends that the laws enactment in 1953 would have been pointless surplusage if States already had concurrent jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  But Public Law 280 contains no language preempting state jurisdiction.  And Public Law 280 encompasses far more than just non-Indian on Indian crimes.  Thus, resolution of the narrow jurisdictional issue here does not negate the significance of Public Law 280.  Pp.1618. (2)The test articulated in White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker,\\n448 U.S. 136, does not bar the State from prosecuting crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  There, the Court held that even when federal law does not preempt state jurisdiction under ordinary preemption analysis, preemption may still occur if the exercise of state jurisdiction would unlawfully infringe upon tribal self-government.  Id., at 142143.  Under Brackers balancing test, the Court considers tribal interests, federal interests, and state interests.  Id., at 145.  Here, the exercise of state jurisdiction would not infringe on tribal self-government.  And because a States jurisdiction is concurrent with federal jurisdiction, a state prosecution would not preclude an earlier or later federal prosecution.  Finally, the State has a strong sovereign interest in ensuring public safety and criminal justice within its territory, including an interest in protecting both Indian and non-Indian crime victims.  Pp.1820. (c)This Court has long held that Indian country is part of a State, not separate from it.  Under the Constitution, States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes within their territory except when preempted by federal law or by principles of tribal self-government.  The default is that States have criminal jurisdiction in Indian country unless that jurisdiction is preempted.  And that jurisdiction has not been preempted here. Pp. 2125. Reversed and remanded.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21429 _________________ OKLAHOMA, PETITIONER v. VICTOR MANUEL CASTRO-HUERTA on writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of oklahoma [June 29, 2022]  Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the Court. This case presents a jurisdictional question about the prosecution of crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country:  Under current federal law, does the Federal Government have exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute those crimes?  Or do the Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute those crimes?  We conclude that the Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. I In 2015, Victor Manuel Castro-Huerta lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with his wife and their several children, including Castro-Huertas then-5-year-old stepdaughter, who is a Cherokee Indian.  The stepdaughter has cerebral palsy and is legally blind.  One day in 2015, Castro-Huertas sister-in-law was in the house and noticed that the young girl was sick.  After a 911 call, the girl was rushed to a Tulsa hospital in critical condition.  Dehydrated, emaciated, and covered in lice and excrement, she weighed only 19 pounds.  Investigators later found her bed filled with bedbugs and cockroaches. When questioned, Castro-Huerta admitted that he had severely undernourished his stepdaughter during the preceding month.  The State of Oklahoma criminally charged both Castro-Huerta and his wife for child neglect.  Both were convicted.  Castro-Huerta was sentenced to 35 years of imprisonment, with the possibility of parole.  This case concerns the States prosecution of Castro-Huerta. After Castro-Huerta was convicted and while his appeal was pending in state court, this Court decided McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U.S. ___ (2020).  In McGirt, the Court held that Congress had never properly disestablished the Creek Nations reservation in eastern Oklahoma.  As a result, the Court concluded that the Creek Reservation remained Indian country.  Id., at ______, ___, ___ (slip op., at 13, 17, 28).  The status of that part of Oklahoma as Indian country meant that different jurisdictional rules might apply for the prosecution of criminal offenses in that area.  See 18 U.S.C. 11511153.  Based on McGirts reasoning, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals later recognized that several other Indian reservations in Oklahoma had likewise never been properly disestablished.  See, e.g., State exrel. Matloff v. Wallace, 2021 OK CR 21, 15, 497 P.3d 686, 689 (reaffirming recognition of the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Reservations); Grayson v. State, 2021 OK CR 8, 10, 485 P.3d 250, 254 (Seminole Reservation). In light of McGirt and the follow-on cases, the eastern part of Oklahoma, including Tulsa, is now recognized as Indian country.  About two million people live there, and the vast majority are not Indians. The classification of eastern Oklahoma as Indian country has raised urgent questions about which government or governments have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed there.  This case is an example:  a crime committed in what is now recognized as Indian country (Tulsa) by a non-Indian (Castro-Huerta) against an Indian (his stepdaughter).  All agree that the Federal Government has jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  The question is whether the Federal Governments jurisdiction is exclusive, or whether the State also has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Government. In the wake of McGirt, Castro-Huerta argued that the Federal Governments jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by a non-Indian against an Indian in Indian country is exclusive and that the State therefore lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him.  The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals agreed with Castro-Huerta.  Relying on an earlier Oklahoma decision holding that the federal General Crimes Act grants the Federal Government exclusive jurisdiction, the court ruled that the State did not have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  The court therefore vacated Castro-Huertas conviction.  No. F20171203 (Apr. 29, 2021); see also Bosse v. State, 2021 OK CR 3, 484 P.3d 286; Roth v. State, 2021 OK CR 27, 499 P.3d 23. While Castro-Huertas state appellate proceedings were ongoing, a federal grand jury in Oklahoma indicted Castro-Huerta for the same conduct.  Castro-Huerta accepted a plea agreement for a 7-year sentence followed by removal from the United States.  (Castro-Huerta is not a U.S. citizen and is unlawfully in the United States.)  In other words, putting aside parole possibilities, Castro-Huerta in effect received a 28-year reduction of his sentence as a result of McGirt. Castro-Huertas case exemplifies a now-familiar pattern in Oklahoma in the wake of McGirt.  The Oklahoma courts have reversed numerous state convictions on that same jurisdictional ground.  After having their state convictions reversed, some non-Indian criminals have received lighter sentences in plea deals negotiated with the Federal Government.  Others have simply gone free.  Going forward, the State estimates that it will have to transfer prosecutorial responsibility for more than 18,000 cases per year to the Federal and Tribal Governments.  All of this has created a significant challenge for the Federal Government and for the people of Oklahoma.  At the end of fiscal year 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice was opening only 22% and 31% of all felony referrals in the Eastern and Northern Districts of Oklahoma.  Dept. of Justice, U.S. Attorneys, Fiscal Year 2023 Congressional Justification 46.  And the Department recently acknowledged that many people may not be held accountable for their criminal conduct due to resource constraints.  Ibid. In light of the sudden significance of this jurisdictional question for public safety and the criminal justice system in Oklahoma, this Court granted certiorari to decide whether a State has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Government to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  595 U.S. ___ (2022).[1] II The jurisdictional dispute in this case arises because Oklahomas territory includes Indian country.  Federal law defines Indian country to include, among other things, all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government.\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1151. To begin with, the Constitution allows a State to exercise jurisdiction in Indian country.  Indian country is part of the State, not separate from the State.  To be sure, under this Courts precedents, federal law may preempt that state jurisdiction in certain circumstances.  But otherwise, as a matter of state sovereignty, a State has jurisdiction over all of its territory, including Indian country.  See U.S. Const., Amdt. 10.  As this Court has phrased it, a State is generally entitled to the sovereignty and jurisdiction over all the territory within her limits.  Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 228 (1845). In the early years of the Republic, the Federal Government sometimes treated Indian country as separate from state territoryin the same way that, for example, New Jersey is separate from New York.  Most prominently, in the 1832 decision in Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 561, this Court held that Georgia state law had no force in the Cherokee Nation because the Cherokee Nation is a distinct community occupying its own territory. But the general notion drawn from Chief Justice Marshalls opinion in Worcester v. Georgia has yielded to closer analysis.  Organized Village of Kake v. Egan,\\n\\n369 U.S. 60, 72 (1962).  By 1880 the Court no longer viewed reservations as distinct nations.  Ibid.  Since the latter half of the 1800s, the Court has consistently and explicitly held that Indian reservations are part of the surrounding State and subject to the States jurisdiction except as forbidden by federal law.  Ibid. To take a few examples:  In 1859, the Court stated:  States retain the power of a sovereign over their persons and property, so far as necessary to preserve the peace of the Commonwealth.  New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble, 21 How. 366, 370 (1859). In 1930:  [R]eservations are part of the State within which they lie and her laws, civil and criminal, have the same force therein as elsewhere within her limits, save that they can have only restricted application to the Indian wards.  Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook,\\n\\n281 U.S. 647, 651 (1930). In 1946:  [I]n the absence of a limiting treaty obligation or Congressional enactment each state ha[s] a right to exercise jurisdiction over Indian reservations within its boundaries.  New York ex rel. Ray v. Martin,\\n\\n326 U.S. 496, 499 (1946). In 1992:  This Courts more recent cases have recognized the rights of States, absent a congressional prohibition, to exercise criminal (and, implicitly, civil) jurisdiction over non-Indians located on reservation lands.  County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation,\\n\\n502 U.S. 251, 257258 (1992). And as recently as 2001:  State sovereignty does not end at a reservations border.  Nevada v. Hicks,\\n\\n533 U.S. 353, 361 (2001). In accord with that overarching jurisdictional principle dating back to the 1800s, States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in Indian country unless preempted.  In the leading case in the criminal contextthe McBratney case from 1882this Court held that States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against non-Indians in Indian country.  United States v. McBratney, \\n104 U.S. 621, 623624 (1882).  The Court stated that Colorado had criminal jurisdiction over crimes by non-Indians against non-Indians throughout the whole of the territory within its limits, including the Ute Reservation.  Id., at 624.  Several years later, the Court similarly decided that Montana had criminal jurisdiction over crimes by non-Indians against non-Indians in Indian country within that State.  Draper v. United States,\\n\\n164 U.S. 240, 244247 (1896).  The McBratney principle remains good law. In short, the Courts precedents establish that Indian country is part of a States territory and that, unless preempted, States have jurisdiction over crimes committed in Indian country. III The central question that we must decide, therefore, is whether the States authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country has been preempted.  U. S. Const., Art.VI. Under the Courts precedents, as we will explain, a States jurisdiction in Indian country may be preempted (i)by federal law under ordinary principles of federal preemption, or (ii) when the exercise of state jurisdiction would unlawfully infringe on tribal self-government. In Part IIIA, we consider whether state authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country is preempted by federal law under ordinary principles of preemption.  In Part IIIB, we consider whether principles of tribal self-government preclude the exercise of state jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. A Castro-Huerta points to two federal laws that, in his view, preempt Oklahomas authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country: (i) the General Crimes Act, which grants the Federal Government jurisdiction to prosecute crimes in Indian country,\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1152; and (ii) Public Law 280, which grants States, or authorizes States to acquire, certain additional jurisdiction over crimes committed in Indian country,\\n\\n67Stat.\\n588; see\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1162;\\n\\n25 U.S.C. 1321.  Neither statute preempts preexisting or otherwise lawfully assumed state authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. 1 As relevant here, the General Crimes Act provides:  Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, except the District of Columbia, shall extend to the Indian country.\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1152. By its terms, the Act does not preempt the States authority to prosecute non-Indians who commit crimes against Indians in Indian country.  The text of the Act simply extend[s] federal law to Indian country, leaving untouched the background principle of state jurisdiction over crimes committed within the State, including in Indian country.  Ibid. The Act also specifies the body of federal criminal law that extends to Indian countrynamely, the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.  Ibid.  Those cross-referenced general laws are the federal laws that apply in federal enclaves such as military bases and national parks.  Ibid. Importantly, however, the General Crimes Act does not say that Indian country is equivalent to a federal enclave for jurisdictional purposes.  Nor does the Act say that federal jurisdiction is exclusive in Indian country, or that state jurisdiction is preempted in Indian country. Under the General Crimes Act, therefore, both the Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in Indian country.[2]  The General Crimes Act does not preempt state authority to prosecute Castro-Huertas crime. To overcome the text, Castro-Huerta offers several counterarguments.  None is persuasive. First, Castro-Huerta advances what he describes as a textual argument.  He contends that the text of the General Crimes Act makes Indian country the jurisdictional equivalent of a federal enclave.  To begin, he points out that the Federal Government has exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in federal enclaves such as military bases and national parks.  And then Castro-Huerta asserts that the General Crimes Act in effect equates federal enclaves and Indian country.  Therefore, according to Castro-Huerta, it follows that the Federal Government also has exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in Indian country. Castro-Huertas syllogism is wrong as a textual matter.  The Act simply borrows the body of federal criminal law that applies in federal enclaves and extends it to Indian country.  The Act does not purport to equate Indian country and federal enclaves for jurisdictional purposes.  Moreover, it is not enough to speculate, as Castro-Huerta does, that Congress might have implicitly intended a jurisdictional parallel between Indian country and federal enclaves. Castro-Huertas argument also directly contradicts this Courts precedents.  As far back as 1891, the Court stated that the phrase sole and exclusive jurisdiction in the General Crimes Act is only used in the description of the laws which are extended to Indian country, not to the jurisdiction extended over the Indian country.  In re Wilson,\\n\\n140 U.S. 575, 578 (1891).  The Court repeated that analysis in 1913, concluding that the phrase sole and exclusive jurisdiction is used in order to describe the laws of the United States which by that section are extended to the Indian country.  Donnelly v. United States, \\n228 U.S. 243, 268 (1913). Stated otherwise, the General Crimes Act provides that the federal criminal laws that apply to federal enclaves also apply in Indian country.  But the extension of those federal laws to Indian country does not silently erase preexisting or otherwise lawfully assumed state jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians in Indian country. Moreover, if Castro-Huertas interpretation of the General Crimes Act were correct, then the Act would preclude States from prosecuting any crimes in Indian countrypresumably even those crimes committed by non-Indians against non-Indiansjust as States ordinarily cannot prosecute crimes committed in federal enclaves.  But this Court has long held that States may prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against non-Indians in Indian country.  See McBratney, 104 U.S., at 623624; Draper, 164 U.S., at 242246.  Those holdings, too, contravene Castro-Huertas argument regarding the General Crimes Act. In advancing his enclave argument, Castro-Huerta also tries to analogize the text of the General Crimes Act to the text of the Major Crimes Act.  He asserts that the Major Crimes Act grants the Federal Government exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute certain major crimes committed by Indians in Indian country.  But the Major Crimes Act contains substantially different language than the General Crimes Act.  Unlike the General Crimes Act, the Major Crimes Act says that defendants in Indian country shall be subject to the same law as defendants in federal enclaves.  See\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1153 (Any Indian who commits against the person or property of another Indian or other person any of certain major offenses shall be subject to the same law and penalties as all other persons committing any of the above offenses, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States).  So even assuming that the text of the Major Crimes Act provides for exclusive federal jurisdiction over major crimes committed by Indians in Indian country, see, e.g., United States v. John,\\n\\n437 U.S. 634, 651, and n. 22 (1978); Negonsott v. Samuels,\\n\\n507 U.S. 99, 103 (1993), that conclusion does not translate to the differently worded General Crimes Act. In short, the General Crimes Act does not treat Indian country as the equivalent of a federal enclave for jurisdictional purposes.  Nor does the Act make federal jurisdiction exclusive or preempt state law in Indian country. Second, Castro-Huerta contends that, regardless of the statutory text, Congress implicitly intended for the General Crimes Act to provide the Federal Government with exclusive jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. The fundamental problem with Castro-Huertas implicit intent argument is that the text of the General Crimes Act says no such thing.  Congress expresses its intentions through statutory text passed by both Houses and signed by the President (or passed over a Presidential veto).  As this Court has repeatedly stated, the text of a law controls over purported legislative intentions unmoored from any statutory text.  The Court may not replace the actual text with speculation as to Congress intent.  Magwood v. Patterson,\\n\\n561 U.S. 320, 334 (2010).  Rather, the Court will presume more modestly that the legislature says what it means and means what it says.  Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc.,\\n\\n582 U.S. 79, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see, e.g., McGirt, 591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) ([W]ishes are not laws); Virginia Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 587 U.S. ___, ___ (2019) (lead opinion) (slip op., at 14) (The Supremacy Clause cannot be deployed to elevate abstract and unenacted legislative desires above state law); Alexander v. Sandoval,\\n\\n532 U.S. 275, 287288 (2001) (The Court does not give dispositive weight to the expectations that the enacting Congress had formed in light of the contemporary legal context, because we begin (and find that we can end) our search for Congresss intent with ... text and structure (internal quotation marks omitted)); Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.,\\n\\n511 U.S. 164, 173 (1994) ([T]he text of the statute controls our decision). To buttress his implicit intent argument, Castro-Huerta seizes on the history of the General Crimes Act.  At the time of the Acts earliest iterations in 1817 and 1834, Indian country was separate from the States.  Therefore, at that time, state law did not apply in Indian countryin the same way that New York law would not ordinarily have applied in New Jersey.  But territorial separationnot jurisdictional preemption by the General Crimes Actwas the reason that state authority did not extend to Indian country at that time. Because Congress operated under a different territorial paradigm in 1817 and 1834, it had no reason at that time to consider whether to preempt preexisting or lawfully assumed state criminal authority in Indian country.  For present purposes, the fundamental point is that the text of the General Crimes Act does not preempt state law.  And this Court does not rewrite a constitutionally valid statutory text under the banner of speculation about what Congress might have done had it faced a question that ... it never faced.  Henson, 582 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  The history of territorial separation during the early years of the Republic is not a license or excuse to rewrite the text of the General Crimes Act. As noted above, the Worcester-era understanding of Indian country as separate from the State was abandoned later in the 1800s.  After that change, Indian country in each State became part of that States territory.  But Congress did not alter the General Crimes Act to make federal criminal jurisdiction exclusive in Indian country.  To this day, the text of the General Crimes Act still does not make federal jurisdiction exclusive or preempt state jurisdiction. In 1882, in McBratney, moreover, this Court held that States have jurisdiction to prosecute at least some crimes committed in Indian country.  Since 1882, therefore, Congress has been specifically aware that state criminal laws apply to some extent in Indian country.  Yet since then, Congress has never enacted new legislation that would render federal jurisdiction exclusive or preempt state jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians in Indian country.  Additionally, in 1979, the Office of Legal Counsel stated that this Court had not resolved the specific issue of state jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country, and that the issue was not settled.  3 Op. OLC 111, 117119 (1979).  Yet Congress still did not act to make federal jurisdiction exclusive or to preempt state jurisdiction. On a different tack, Castro-Huerta invokes the reenactment canon.  Castro-Huerta points out that, in 1948, Congress recodified the General Crimes Act.  Two years before that recodification, this Court suggested in dicta that States lack jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  See Williams v. United States,\\n\\n327 U.S. 711, 714 (1946).  Castro-Huerta contends that the 1948 Congress therefore intended to ratify the Williams dicta. Castro-Huertas reenactment-canon argument is misplaced.  First of all, the reenactment canon does not override clear statutory language of the kind present in the General Crimes Act.  See BP p.l.c. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 593 U.S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 11).  In addition, the canon does not apply to dicta.  See Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,\\n\\n543 U.S. 335, 349, 351, n. 12 (2005).  The Courts statements in Williams were pure dicta.  Indeed, the Williams dicta did not even purport to interpret the text of the General Crimes Act.  Dicta that does not analyze the relevant statutory provision cannot be said to have resolved the statutes meaning.  Moreover, any inference from Congresss 1948 recodification is especially weak because that recodification was not specific to the General Crimes Act, but instead was simply a general recodification of all federal criminal laws.  This Court has previously explained that the function of the 1948 recodification was generally limited to that of consolidation and codification.  Muniz v. Hoffman,\\n\\n422 U.S. 454, 474 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This Court does not infer that Congress, in revising and consolidating the laws, intended to change their policy, unless such an intention be clearly expressed.  Id., at 470 (internal quotation marks omitted). For many reasons, then, we cannot conclude that Congress, by recodifying the entire Federal Criminal Code in 1948, silently ratified a few sentences of dicta from Williams.  The reenactment canon does not apply in this case. Third, Castro-Huerta contends that the Court has repeated the 1946 Williams dicta on several subsequent occasions.  But the Courts dicta, even if repeated, does not constitute precedent and does not alter the plain text of the General Crimes Act, which was the law passed by Congress and signed by the President.  See National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Alston, 594 U.S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 21).[3] Moreover, there is a good explanation for why the Courts previous comments on this issue came only in the form of tangential dicta.  The question of whether States have concurrent jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country did not previously matter all that much and did not warrant this Courts review.  Through congressional grants of authority in Public Law 280 or state-specific statutes, some States with substantial Indian populations have long possessed broad jurisdiction to prosecute a vast array of crimes in Indian country (including crimes by Indians).  See Brief for National Congress of American Indians as Amicus Curiae 20, and n.2.  Indeed, Castro-Huerta notes that 21 States have jurisdiction over crimes by or against Indians in some Indian country.  Brief for Respondent 7.  So the General Crimes Act questionnamely, whether that Act preempts inherent state prosecutorial authority in Indian countrywas not relevant in those States. In any event, this Court never considered the General Crimes Act preemption question.  As the Office of Legal Counsel put it, many courts, without carefully considering the question, have assumed that Federal jurisdictio[n] whenever it obtains is exclusive.  We nevertheless believe that it is a matter that should not be regarded as settled before it has been fully explored by the courts.  3 Op. OLC, at 117.  This case is the first time that the matter has been fully explored by this Court. Until the Courts decision in McGirt two years ago, this question likewise did not matter much in Oklahoma.  Most everyone in Oklahoma previously understood that the State included almost no Indian country.  McGirt, 590 U.S., at ______ (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3132).  But after McGirt, about 43% of Oklahomaincluding Tulsais now considered Indian country.  Therefore, the question of whether the State of Oklahoma retains concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute non-Indian on Indian crimes in Indian country has suddenly assumed immense importance.  The jurisdictional question has now been called.  In light of the newfound significance of the question, it is necessary and appropriate for this Court to take its first hard look at the text and structure of the General Crimes Act, rather than relying on scattered dicta about a question that, until now, was relatively insignificant in the real world. After independently examining the question, we have concluded that the General Crimes Act does not preempt state jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. 2 Castro-Huerta next invokes Public Law 280 as a source of preemption.  That argument is similarly unpersuasive. Public Law 280 affirmatively grants certain States broad jurisdiction to prosecute state-law offenses committed by or against Indians in Indian country.  See\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1162.  (Other States may opt in, with tribal consent.\\n\\n25 U.S.C. 1321.)  But Public Law 280 does not preempt any preexisting or otherwise lawfully assumed jurisdiction that States possess to prosecute crimes in Indian country.  Indeed, the Court has already concluded as much:  Nothing in the language or legislative history of Pub. L. 280 indicates that it was meant to divest States of pre-existing and otherwise lawfully assumed jurisdiction.  Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P.C., 467 U.S. 138, 150 (1984).  The Courts definitive statement in Three Affiliated Tribes about Public Law 280 applies to both civil and criminal jurisdiction.  And the Courts statement follows ineluctably from the statutory text:  Public Law 280 contains no language that preempts States civil or criminal jurisdiction. Castro-Huerta separately contends that the enactment of Public Law 280 in 1953 would have been pointless surplusage if States already had concurrent jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  So he says that, as of 1953, Congress must have assumed that States did not already have concurrent jurisdiction over those crimes.  To begin with, assumptions are not laws, and the fact remains that Public Law 280 contains no language preempting state jurisdiction, as the Court already held in Three Affiliated Tribes.  Apart from that, Public Law 280 encompasses far more than just non-Indian on Indian crimes (the issue here).  Public Law 280 also grants States jurisdiction over crimes committed by Indians.  See Conference of Western Attorneys General, American Indian Law Deskbook 4.6, p. 250251 (2021 ed.); cf. Negonsott, 507 U.S., at 105107.  Absent Public Law 280, state jurisdiction over those Indian-defendant crimes could implicate principles of tribal self-government.  See White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker,\\n\\n448 U.S. 136, 142143 (1980); Part IIIB, infra.  So our resolution of the narrow jurisdictional issue in this case does not negate the significance of Public Law 280 in affording States broad criminal jurisdiction over other crimes committed in Indian country, such as crimes committed by Indians.[4] In any event, to the extent that there is any overlap (or even complete overlap) between Public Law 280s jurisdictional grant and some of the States preexisting jurisdiction with respect to crimes committed in Indian country, it made good sense for Congress in 1953 to explicitly grant such authority in Public Law 280.  The scope of the States authority had not previously been resolved by this Court, except in cases such as McBratney and Draper with respect to non-Indian on non-Indian crimes.  Congressional action in the face of such legal uncertainty cannot reasonably be characterized as unnecessary surplusage.  See Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. ___, ______ (2019) (slip op., at 2021).  And finally, even if there is some surplusage, the Court has stated that [r]edundancy is not a silver bullet when interpreting statutes.  Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc., 586 U.S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 11). In sum, Public Law 280 does not preempt state authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. B Applying what has been referred to as the Bracker balancing test, this Court has recognized that even when federal law does not preempt state jurisdiction under ordinary preemption analysis, preemption may still occur if the exercise of state jurisdiction would unlawfully infringe upon tribal self-government.  See Bracker, 448 U.S., at 142143; see also New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe,\\n\\n462 U.S. 324, 333335 (1983).  Under the Bracker balancing test, the Court considers tribal interests, federal interests, and state interests.  448 U.S., at 145.[5] Here, Bracker does not bar the State from prosecuting crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. First, the exercise of state jurisdiction here would not infringe on tribal self-government.  In particular, a state prosecution of a crime committed by a non-Indian against an Indian would not deprive the tribe of any of its prosecutorial authority.  That is because, with exceptions not invoked here, Indian tribes lack criminal jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians such as Castro-Huerta, even when non-Indians commit crimes against Indians in Indian country.  See Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe,\\n\\n435 U.S. 191, 195 (1978). Moreover, a state prosecution of a non-Indian does not involve the exercise of state power over any Indian or over any tribe.  The only parties to the criminal case are the State and the non-Indian defendant.  Therefore, as has been recognized, any tribal self-government justification for preemption of state jurisdiction would be problematic.  American Indian Law Deskbook 4.8, at 260; see Three Affiliated Tribes, 467 U.S., at 148; see also Hicks, 533 U.S., at 364; McBratney, 104 U.S., at 623624; Draper, 164 U.S., at 242243.[6] Second, a state prosecution of a non-Indian likewise would not harm the federal interest in protecting Indian victims.  State prosecution would supplement federal authority, not supplant federal authority.  As the United States has explained in the past, recognition of concurrent state jurisdiction could facilitate effective law enforcement on the Reservation, and thereby further the federal and tribal interests in protecting Indians and their property against the actions of non-Indians.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Arizona v. Flint, O. T. 1988, No. 603, p.6.  The situation might be different if state jurisdiction ousted federal jurisdiction.  But because the States jurisdiction would be concurrent with federal jurisdiction, a state prosecution would not preclude an earlier or later federal prosecution and would not harm the federal interest in protecting Indian victims. Third, the State has a strong sovereign interest in ensuring public safety and criminal justice within its territory, and in protecting all crime victims.  See Dibble, 21 How., at 370.  The State also has a strong interest in ensuring that criminal offendersespecially violent offendersare appropriately punished and do not harm others in the State. The States interest in protecting crime victims includes both Indian and non-Indian victims.  If his victim were a non-Indian, Castro-Huerta could be prosecuted by the State, as he acknowledges.  But because his victim is an Indian, Castro-Huerta says that he is free from state prosecution.  Castro-Huertas argument would require this Court to treat Indian victims as second-class citizens.  We decline to do so.[7] IV The dissent emphasizes the history of mistreatment of American Indians.  But that history does not resolve the legal questions presented in this case.  Those questions are:  (i)whether Indian country is part of a State or instead is separate and independent from a State; and (ii)if Indian country is part of a State, whether the State has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Government to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. The answers to those questions are straightforward.  On the first question, as explained above, this Court has repeatedly ruled that Indian country is part of a State, not separate from a State.  By contrast, the dissent lifts up the 1832 decision in Worcester v. Georgia as a proper exposition of Indian law.  But this Court long ago made clear that Worcester rested on a mistaken understanding of the relationship between Indian country and the States.  The Court has stated that the general notion drawn from Chief Justice Marshalls opinion in Worcester v. Georgia has yielded to closer analysis:  By 1880 the Court no longer viewed reservations as distinct nations.  On the contrary, it was said that a reservation was in many cases a part of the surrounding State or Territory, and subject to its jurisdiction except as forbidden by federal law.  Organized Village of Kake, 369 U.S., at 72. Because Indian country is part of a State, not separate from a State, the second question herethe question regarding the States jurisdiction to prosecute Castro-Huertais also straightforward.  Under the Constitution, States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes within their territory except when preempted (in a manner consistent with the Constitution) by federal law or by principles of tribal self-government.  As we have explained, no federal law preempts the States exercise of jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  And principles of tribal self-government likewise do not preempt state jurisdiction here. As a corollary to its argument that Indian country is inherently separate from States, the dissent contends that Congress must affirmatively authorize States to exercise jurisdiction in Indian country, even jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians.  But under the Constitution and this Courts precedents, the default is that States may exercise criminal jurisdiction within their territory.  See Amdt. 10.  States do not need a permission slip from Congress to exercise their sovereign authority.  In other words, the default is that States have criminal jurisdiction in Indian country unless that jurisdiction is preempted.  In the dissents view, by contrast, the default is that States do not have criminal jurisdiction in Indian country unless Congress specifically provides it.  The dissents view is inconsistent with the Constitutions structure, the States inherent sovereignty, and the Courts precedents. Straying further afield, the dissent seizes on treaties from the 1800s.  Post, at 1820, and n.4 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).[8]  But those treaties do not preclude state jurisdiction here.  The dissent relies heavily on the 1835 Treaty of New Echota, which stated that Indian country was separate from States, and which the dissent says was preserved in relevant part by the 1866 Treaty.  See Treaty with the Cherokee (New Echota), Art. 5, Dec. 29, 1835,\\n\\n7Stat.\\n481; Treaty with the Cherokee, July 19, 1866,\\n\\n14Stat.\\n709.  But history and legal development did not end in 1866.  Some early treaties may have been consistent with the Worcester-era theory of separateness.  But as relevant here, those treaties have been supplanted:  Specific to Oklahoma, those treaties, in relevant part, were formally supplanted no later than the 1906 Act enabling Oklahomas statehood.  See Oklahoma Enabling Act, ch.3335,\\n\\n34Stat.\\n267.  As this Court has previously concluded, admission of a State into the Union necessarily repeals the provisions of any prior statute, or of any existing treaty that is inconsistent with the States exercise of criminal jurisdiction throughout the whole of the territory within its limits, including Indian country, unless the enabling act says otherwise by express words.  McBratney, 104 U.S., at 623624; see Draper, 164 U.S., at 242246.  The Oklahoma Enabling Act contains no such express exception.  Therefore, at least since Oklahomas statehood in the early 1900s, Indian country has been part of the territory of Oklahoma. The dissent responds that the language of the 1906 statute enabling Oklahomas statehood itself established a jurisdictional division between the State and Indian country.  See post, at 2022 (discussing the Oklahoma Enabling Act).  That argument is mistaken.  This Court long ago explained that interpreting a statehood act to divest a State of jurisdiction over Indian country wholly situated within [its] geographical boundaries would undermine the very nature of the equality conferred on the State by virtue of its admission into the Union.  Draper, 164 U.S., at 242243.  So the Court requires clear statutory language to create an exception to that rule.  Id., at 244.  To reiterate, the Oklahoma Enabling Act contains no such clear language.  Indeed, the Court has interpreted similar statutory language in other state enabling acts not to displace state jurisdiction.  See id., at 243247; Organized Village of Kake, 369 U.S., at 6771.  In Organized Village of Kake, the Court specifically addressed several state enabling acts, including the Oklahoma Enabling Act, and stated that statutory language reserving jurisdiction and control to the United States was meant to preserve federal jurisdiction to the extent that it existed before statehood, not to make federal jurisdiction exclusive.  Id., at 6770.  Consistent with that precedent, todays decision recognizes that the Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.[9] The dissent incorrectly seeks to characterize various aspects of the Courts decision as dicta.  To be clear, the Court today holds that Indian country within a States territory is part of a State, not separate from a State.  Therefore, a State has jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in Indian country unless state jurisdiction is preempted.  With respect to crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country, the Court today further holds that the General Crimes Act does not preempt the States authority to prosecute; that Public Law 280 does not preempt the States authority to prosecute; that no principle of tribal self-government preempts the States authority to prosecute; that the cited treaties do not preempt Oklahomas authority to prosecute; and that the Oklahoma Enabling Act does not preempt Oklahomas authority to prosecute (indeed, it solidifies the States presumptive sovereign authority to prosecute).  Comments in the dissenting opinion suggesting anything otherwise are just that: comments in a dissenting opinion.  Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz,\\n\\n449 U.S. 166, 177, n. 10 (1980). From start to finish, the dissent employs extraordinary rhetoric in articulating its deeply held policy views about what Indian law should be.  The dissent goes so far as to draft a proposed statute for Congress.  But this Courts proper role under Article III of the Constitution is to declare what the law is, not what we think the law should be.  The dissents views about the jurisdictional question presented in this case are contrary to this Courts precedents and to the laws enacted by Congress. *** We conclude that the Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered. &&& SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21429 _________________ OKLAHOMA, PETITIONER v. VICTOR MANUEL CASTRO-HUERTA on writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of oklahoma [June 29, 2022]  Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting. In 1831, Georgia arrested Samuel Worcester, a white missionary, for preaching to the Cherokee on tribal lands without a license.  Really, the prosecution was a show of forcean attempt by the State to demonstrate its authority over tribal lands.  Speaking for this Court, Chief Justice Marshall refused to endorse Georgias ploy because the State enjoyed no lawful right to govern the territory of a separate sovereign.  See Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 561 (1832).  The Courts decision was deeply unpopular, and both Georgia and President Jackson flouted it.  But in time, Worcester came to be recognized as one of this Courts finer hours.  The decision established a foundational rule that would persist for over 200 years:  Native American Tribes retain their sovereignty unless and until Congress ordains otherwise.  Worcester proved that, even in the [c]ourts of the conqueror, the rule of law meant something.  Johnsons Lessee v. McIntosh, 8 Wheat. 543, 588 (1823). Where this Court once stood firm, today it wilts.  After the Cherokees exile to what became Oklahoma, the federal government promised the Tribe that it would remain forever free from interference by state authorities.  Only the Tribe or the federal government could punish crimes by or against tribal members on tribal lands.  At various points in its history, Oklahoma has chafed at this limitation.  Now, the State seeks to claim for itself the power to try crimes by non-Indians against tribal members within the Cherokee Reservation.  Where our predecessors refused to participate in one States unlawful power grab at the expense of the Cherokee, todays Court accedes to anothers.  Respectfully, I dissent. I A Long before our Republic, the Cherokee controlled much of what is now Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.  See 1 G. Litton, History of Oklahoma at the Golden Anniversary of Statehood 91 (1957) (Litton).  The Cherokee were a distinct, independent political communit[y], who retain[ed] their original sovereign right to regulat[e] their internal and social relations.  Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez,\\n\\n436 U.S. 49, 55 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted). As colonists settled coastal areas near Cherokee territory, the Tribe proved a valuable trading partnerand a military threat.  See W. Echo-Hawk, In the Court of the Conqueror 89 (2010).  Recognizing this, Great Britain signed a treaty with the Cherokee in 1730.  See 1 Litton 92.  As was true of tributary and feudatory states in Europe, the Cherokee did not cease to be sovereign and independent under this arrangement, but retained the right to govern their internal affairs.  E.de Vattel, Law of Nations 6061 (1805); see Worcester, 6 Pet., at 561.  Meanwhile, under British law the crown possessed centraliz[ed] authority over diplomacy with Tribes to the exclusion of colonial governments.  See C.Berkey, United StatesIndian Relations: The Constitutional Basis, in Exiled in the Land of the Free 192 (H. Lyons ed. 1992). Ultimately, the American Revolution replaced that legal framework with a similar one.  When the delegates drafted the Articles of Confederation, they debated whether the national or state authorities should manage Indian affairs.  See 6 Journals of the Continental Congress, 17741789, pp. 10771079 (W. Ford ed. 1906).  The resulting compromise proved unworkable.  The Articles granted Congress the sole and exclusive right and power of ... regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians.  Art. IX.  But the Articles undermined that assignment by further providing that the legislative right of any state[,] within its own limits, could not be infringed or violated.  Ibid.  Together, these provisions led to battles between national and state governments over who could oversee relations with various Tribes.  See G. Ablavsky, Beyond the Indian Commerce Clause, 124 Yale L.J. 1012, 10331035 (2015) (Ablavsky).  James Madison later complained that the Articles division of authority over Indian affairs had endeavored to accomplish [an] impossibilit[y]; to reconcile a partial sovereignty in the Union, with complete sovereignty in the States.  The Federalist No. 42, p. 269 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). When the framers convened to draft a new Constitution, this problem was among those they sought to resolve.  To that end, they gave the federal government broad general powers over Indian affairs.  United States v. Lara,\\n\\n541 U.S. 193, 200 (2004).  The Constitution afforded Congress authority to make war and negotiate treaties with the Tribes.  See Art. I,  8; Art. VI, cl.2.  It barred States from doing either of these things.  See Art. I, 10.  And the Constitution granted Congress the power to regulate Commerce ... with the Indian Tribes.  Art. I, 8, cl. 3.  Nor did the Constitution replicate the Articles carveout for state power over Tribes within their borders.  Madison praised this change, contending that the new federal government would be very properly unfettered from this prior limitatio[n].  The Federalist No. 42, at 268.  Antifederalist Abraham Yates agreed (but bemoaned) that the Constitution totally surrender[ed] into the hands of Congress the management and regulation of the Indian affairs.  Letter to the Citizens of the State of New York (June 1314, 1788), in 20 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution 1153, 1158 (J. Kaminski et al. eds. 2004). Consistent with that view, the Washington Administration insisted that the federal government enjoyed exclusive constitutional authority over tribal relations.  Ablavsky 1019.  The new Administration understood, too, that Tribes remained otherwise free to govern their internal affairs without state interference.  See id., at 10411042, 10651067.  In a letter to the Governor of Pennsylvania, President Washington stated curtly that the United States ... posses[es] the only authority of regulating an intercourse with [the Indians], and redressing their grievances.  Letter to T. Mifflin (Sept. 4, 1790), in 6 Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 396 (D. Twohig ed. 1996).  Even Thomas Jefferson, the great defender of the States powers, agreed that under the present Constitution no State [has] a right to Treat with the Indians without the consent of the General Government.  Letter to H. Knox (Aug. 10, 1791), in 22 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 27 (C. Cullen, E. Sheridan, & R Lester eds. 1986). Nor was this view confined to the Executive Branch.  Congress quickly exercised its new constitutional authority.  In 1790, it enacted the first Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, which pervasively regulated commercial and social exchanges among Indians and non-Indians.  Ch. 33,\\n\\n1Stat.\\n137.  Congress also provided for federal jurisdiction over crimes by non-Indians against Indians on tribal lands.  56, id., at 138.  States, too, recognized their lack of authority.  See Ablavsky 1019, 1043.  In 1789, South Carolina Governor Charles Pinckney acknowledged to Washington that the sole management of India[n] affairs is now committed to the general Government.  Letter to G. Washington (Dec. 14), in 4 Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 401, 404 (D. Twohig ed. 1993).  Initially, even Georgia took the same view.  See Letter from Georgia House of Representatives to Governor Edward Telfair (June 10, 1790), in 3 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution: Delaware, New Jersey, Georgia, and Connecticut 178 (M. Jensen ed. 1978) (Microform Supp. Doc. No. 50). It was against this background that Chief Justice Marshall faced Worcester.  After gold was discovered in Cherokee territory in the 1820s, Georgias Legislature enacted laws designed to seize [the] whole Cherokee country, parcel it out among the neighboring counties of the state ... abolish [the Tribes] institutions and its laws, and annihilate its political existence.  Worcester, 6 Pet., at 542.  Like Oklahoma today, Georgia also purported to extend its criminal laws to Cherokee lands.  See ibid.; see also S. Breyer, The Cherokee Indians and the Supreme Court, 87 The Georgia Historical Q. 408, 416418 (2003) (Breyer).  In refusing to sanction Georgias power grab, this Court explained that the States assertion of jurisdiction over the Cherokee nation was void, because under our Constitution only the federal government possessed the power to manage relations with the Tribe.  Worcester, 6 Pet., at 542, 561562. B  Two years later, and exercising its authority to regulate tribal affairs in the shadow of Worcester, Congress adopted the General Crimes Act of 1834 (GCA).  That law extended federal criminal jurisdiction to tribal lands for certain crimes and, in doing so, served two apparent purposes.  First, as a courtesy to the Tribes, the law represented a promise by the federal government to punish crimes ... committed ... by and against our own [non-Indian] citizens. H.Rep. No. 474, 23d Cong., 1st Sess., 13 (1834) (H. Rep. No. 474).  That jurisdictional arrangement was also consistent with, and even seemingly compelled by, the federal governments treaties with various Tribes.  See F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 731 (N. Newton etal. eds. 2005) (Cohen); R. Clinton, Development of Criminal Jurisdiction Over Indian Lands: The Historical Perspective, 17 Ariz. L.Rev. 951, 958962 (1975) (Clinton).  Second, because Worcester held that States lacked criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands, Congress sought to ensure a federal forum for crimes committed by and against non-Indians.  See H. Rep. No. 474, at 13.  Otherwise, Congress understood, non-Indian settlers would be subject to tribal jurisdiction alone.  See id., at 13, 18; R.Barsh & J. Henderson, The Betrayal, Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe and the Hunting of the Snark, 63 Minn. L. Rev. 609, 625626 (1979).  Congress reenacted the GCA in 1948 with minor amendments, but it remains in force today more or less in its original form.  See 18 U.S.C. 1152 (1946 ed., Supp. II). Shortly after it adopted the GCA, the Senate ratified the Treaty of New Echota with the Cherokee in 1836.  After the Tribes removal from Georgia, the United States promised the Cherokee that they would enjoy a new home in the West where they could establish ... a government of their choice.  Treaty with the Cherokee, Preamble, Dec. 29, 1835,\\n\\n7Stat.\\n478.  Acknowledging the Tribes past difficulties ... under the jurisdiction and laws of the State Governments, the treaty also pledged that the Tribe would remain forever free from State sovereignties.  Ibid.; see Art. 5, id., at 481.  These promises constituted an indemnity, guaranteed by the faith of the nation, that [t]he United States and the Indian tribes [would be] the sole parties with power on new western reservations like the Cherokees.  H.Rep. No. 474, at 18 (emphasis in original). Over time, Congress revised some of these arrangements.  In 1885, dissatisfied with how the Sioux Tribe responded to the murder of a tribal member, Congress adopted the Major Crimes Act (MCA).  See R. Anderson, S. Krakoff, & B. Berger, American Indian Law: Cases and Commentary 9096 (4th ed. 2008) (Anderson).  There, Congress directed that, moving forward, only the federal government, not the Tribes, could prosecute certain serious offenses by tribal members on tribal lands.  See 18 U.S.C. 1153(a).  On its own initiative, this Court then went a step further.  Relying on language in certain laws admitting specific States to the Union, the Court held that States were now entitled to prosecute crimes by non-Indians against non-Indians on tribal lands.  See United States v. McBratney,\\n\\n104 U.S. 621, 623 (1882); Draper v. United States,\\n\\n164 U.S. 240, 243, 247 (1896).  Through all these developments, however, at least one promise remained:  States could play no role in the prosecution of crimes by or against Native Americans on tribal lands.  See Williams v. Lee,\\n\\n358 U.S. 217, 220 (1959). In 1906, Congress reaffirmed this promise to the Cherokee in Oklahoma.  As a condition of its admission to the Union, Congress required Oklahoma to declare that [it] forever disclaim[s] all right and title in or to ... all lands lying within [the States] limits owned or held by any Indian, tribe, or nation.\\n\\n34Stat.\\n270.  Instead, Congress provided that tribal lands would remain subject to the jurisdiction, disposal, and control of the United States.  Ibid.  As if the point wasnt clear enough, Congress further provided that nothing contained in the [new Oklahoma state] constitution shall be construed to ... limit or affect the authority of the Government of the United States ... respecting [the States] Indians ... which it would have been competent to make if this Act had never been passed.  Id., at 267268.  The following year, Oklahoma adopted a State Constitution consistent with Congresss instructions.  Art. I,  3; see also Clinton 961. In the years that followed, certain States sought arrangements different from Oklahomas.  And once more, Congress intervened.  In 1940, Kansas asked for and received permission from Congress to exercise jurisdiction over crimes by or against Indians on tribal lands.  18 U.S.C. 3243.  Through the rest of the decade, Congress experimented with similar laws for New York, Iowa, and North Dakota.[1]  Then, in 1953, Congress adopted Public Law 280.  That statute granted five additional States criminal jurisdiction over offenses ... by or against Indians and established procedures by which further States could secure the same authority.  See ch. 505,  2,\\n\\n67Stat.\\n588.  Ultimately, however, some of these arrangements proved unpopular.  Not only with affected Tribes.  See C. Goldberg-Ambrose, Public Law 280 and the Problem of Lawlessness in California Indian Country, 44 UCLA L. Rev. 1405, 14061407 (1997) (Goldberg-Ambrose).  These arrangements also proved unpopular with certain States that viewed their new law enforcement responsibilities on tribal lands as unfunded federal mandates.  See Anderson 436.  A few States even renounced their Public Law 280 jurisdiction.  See Cohen 579. By 1968, the federal government came to conclude that, as a matter of justice and as a matter of enlightened social policy, the time ha[d] come to break decisively with the past and to create the conditions for a new era in which the Indian future is determined by Indian acts and Indian decisions.  Richard M. Nixon, Special Message on Indian Affairs (July 8, 1970).  Consistent with that vision, Congress amended Public Law 280 to require tribal consent before any State could assume jurisdiction over crimes by or against Indians on tribal lands.  Act of Apr. 11, 1968,  401,\\n\\n82Stat.\\n78, 406, id., at 80 (25 U.S.C.  1321(a), 1326).  Recognizing that certain States enabling acts barred state authority on tribal lands and required States to adopt constitutional provisions guaranteeing as much, Congress also authorized States to amend, where necessary, their State constitution or ... statutes.  404,\\n\\n82Stat.\\n79 (25 U.S.C. 1324).  In doing so, however, Congress emphasized that affected States could not assume jurisdiction to prosecute offenses by or against tribal members on tribal lands until they appropriately amended their State constitution or statutes.  Ibid.  To date, Oklahoma has not amended its state constitutional provisions disclaiming jurisdiction over tribal lands.  Nor has Oklahoma sought or obtained tribal consent to the exercise of its jurisdiction.  See The Honorable E. Kelly Haney, 22 Okla. Op. Atty. Gen. No.  9032, 72, 1991 WL 567868, *1 (Mar. 1, 1991) (Haney).  Thus, Oklahoma has remained, in Congresss words, a State not having jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed by or against Indians in the areas of Indian country situated within its borders.  25 U.S.C. 1321(a). C Rather than seek tribal consent pursuant to Public Law 280 or persuade Congress to adopt a state-specific statute authorizing it to prosecute crimes by or against tribal members on tribal lands, Oklahoma has chosen a different path.  In the decades following statehood, many settlers engaged in schemes to seize Indian lands and mineral rights by subterfuge.  See A.Debo, And Still the Waters Run 92125 (1940) (Debo).  These schemes resulted in the bulk of the landed wealth of the Indians ending up in the hands of the new settlers.  See ibid.; see also id., at 181202.  State officials and courts were sometimes complicit in the process.  See id., at 182183, 185, 195196.  For years, too, Oklahoma courts asserted the power to hear criminal cases involving Native Americans on lands allotted to and owned by tribal members despite the contrary commands of the Oklahoma Enabling Act and the States own constitution.  The State only disavowed that practice in 1991, after defeats in state and federal court.  See Haney, 1991 WL 567868, *1*3; see also State v. Klindt, 782 P.2d 401, 404 (Okla. Crim. App. 1989); Ross v. Neff, 905 F.2d 1349, 1353 (CA10 1990). Still, it seems old habits die slowly.  Even after renouncing the power to try criminal cases involving Native Americans on allotted tribal lands, Oklahoma continued to claim the power to prosecute crimes by or against Native Americans within tribal reservations.  The State did so on the theory that at some (unspecified) point in the past, Congress had disestablished those reservations.  In McGirt v. Oklahoma, this Court rejected that argument in a case involving the Muscogee (Creek) Tribe.  591 U.S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 1).  We explained that Congress had never disestablished the Creek Reservation.  Nor were we willing to usurp Congresss authority and disestablish that reservation by a lawless act of judicial fiat.  See id., at ___ (slip op., at 42).  Accordingly, only federal and tribal authorities were lawfully entitled to try crimes by or against Native Americans within the Tribes reservation.  Ibid.  Following McGirt, Oklahomas courts recognized that what held true for the Creek also held true for the Cherokee:  Congress had never disestablished its reservation and, accordingly, the State lacked authority to try offenses by or against tribal members within the Cherokee Reservation.  See Spears v. State, 2021 OK CR 7,  1014, 485 P.3d 873, 876877. Once more, Oklahoma could have responded to this development by asking Congress for state-specific legislation authorizing it to exercise criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands, as Kansas and various other States have done.  The State could have employed the procedures of Public Law 280 to amend its own laws and obtain tribal consent.  Instead, Oklahoma responded with a media and litigation campaign seeking to portray reservations within its Statewhere federal and tribal authorities may prosecute crimes by and against tribal members and Oklahoma can pursue cases involving only non-Indiansas lawless dystopias.  See Brief for Cherokee Nation etal. as Amici Curiae 18 (Cherokee Brief) (The States tale of a criminal dystopia in eastern Oklahoma is just that: A tale). That effort culminated in this case.  In it, Oklahoma has pursued alternative lines of argument.  First, the State has asked this Court to revisit McGirt and unilaterally eliminate all reservations in Oklahoma.  Second, the State has argued that it enjoys a previously unrecognized inherent authority to try crimes within reservation boundaries by non-Indians against tribal membersa claim Oklahomas own courts have rejected.  See Bosse v. State, 2021 OK CR 3, 484 P.3d 286, 294295. Ultimately, this Court declined to entertain the States first argument but agreed to review the second.  Nominally, the question comes to us in a case involving Victor Castro-Huerta, a non-Indian who abused his Cherokee stepdaughter within the Tribes reservation.  Initially, a state court convicted him for a state crime.  After McGirt, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals determined that his conviction was invalid because only federal and tribal officials possess authority to prosecute crimes by or against Native Americans on the Cherokee Reservation.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a.  The federal government swiftly reindicted Mr. Castro-Huerta, and a federal court again found him guilty.  Now before us, Oklahoma seeks to undo Mr. Castro-Huertas federal conviction and have him transferred from federal prison to a state facility to resume his state sentence. Really, though, this case has less to do with where Mr. Castro-Huerta serves his time and much more to do with Oklahomas effort to gain a legal foothold for its wish to exercise jurisdiction over crimes involving tribal members on tribal lands.  To succeed, Oklahoma must disavow adverse rulings from its own courts; disregard its 1991 recognition that it lacks legal authority to try cases of this sort; and ignore fundamental principles of tribal sovereignty, a treaty, the Oklahoma Enabling Act, its own state constitution, and Public Law 280.  Oklahoma must pursue a proposition so novel and so unlikely that in over two centuries not a single State has successfully attempted it in this Court.  Incredibly, too, the defense of tribal interests against the States gambit falls to a non-Indian criminal defendant.  The real party in interest here isnt Mr. Castro-Huerta but the Cherokee, a Tribe of 400,000 members with its own government.  Yet the Cherokee have no voice as parties in these proceedings; they and other Tribes are relegated to the filing of amicus briefs. II A Today the Court rules for Oklahoma. In doing so, the Court announces that, when it comes to crimes by non-Indians against tribal members within tribal reservations, Oklahoma may exercise jurisdiction.  Ante, at 4.  But this declaration comes as if by oracle, without any sense of the history recounted above and unattached to any colorable legal authority.  Truly, a more ahistorical and mistaken statement of Indian law would be hard to fathom. The source of the Courts error is foundational.  Through most of its opinion, the Court proceeds on the premise that Oklahoma possesses inherent sovereign power to prosecute crimes on tribal reservations until and unless Congress preempt[s] that authority.  Ante, at 518.  The Court emphasizes that States normally wield broad police powers within their borders absent some preemptive federal law.  See ante, at 46; see also Virginia Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 587 U.S. ___, ___ (2019) (lead opinion) (slip op., at 12). But the effort to wedge Tribes into that paradigm is a category error.  Tribes are not private organizations within state boundaries.  Their reservations are not glorified private campgrounds.  Tribes are sovereigns.  And the preemption rule applicable to them is exactly the opposite of the normal rule.  Tribal sovereignty means that the criminal laws of the States can have no force on tribal members within tribal bounds unless and until Congress clearly ordains otherwise.  Worcester, 6 Pet., at 561.  After all, the power to punish crimes by or against ones own citizens within ones own territory to the exclusion of other authorities is and has always been among the most essential attributes of sovereignty.  See, e.g., Wilson v. Girard,\\n\\n354 U.S. 524, 529 (1957) (percuriam) (A sovereign nation has exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders); see also Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, 136 (1812); E. de Vattel, Law of Nations 8182 (1835 ed.). Nor is this notion, ante, at 5, some discarded artifact of a bygone era.  To be sure, Washington, Jefferson, Marshall, and so many others at the Nations founding appreciated the sovereign status of Native American Tribes.  See Part IA, supra.  But this Courts own cases have consistently reaffirmed the point.  Just weeks ago, the Court held that federal prosecutors did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause based on the essential premise that tribal criminal law is the product of a separate sovereig[n] exercising its own retained sovereignty.  Denezpi v. United States, 596 U.S. ___, ___ (2022) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Recently, too, this Court confirmed that Tribes enjoy sovereign immunity from suit.  See Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community,\\n\\n572 U.S. 782, 788789 (2014).   Throughout our history, the basic policy of Worcester that Tribes are separate sovereigns has remained.  Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S., at 219.[2] Because Tribes are sovereigns, this Court has consistently recognized that the usual standards of pre-emption are unhelpful.  White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker,\\n\\n448 U.S. 136, 143 (1980); see also Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico,\\n\\n490 U.S. 163, 176 (1989); Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation,\\n\\n425 U.S. 463, 475476 (1976); McClanahan v. Arizona Tax Commn,\\n\\n411 U.S. 164, 170172 (1973).  In typical preemption cases, courts start with the assumption that Congress has not displaced state authority.  Rice v. SantaFe Elevator Corp.,\\n\\n331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947).  But when a State tries to regulate tribal affairs, the same backdrop does not apply because Tribes have a claim to sovereignty [that] long predates that of our own Government.  McClanahan, 411 U.S., at 172; see also Bracker, 448 U.S., at 143.  So instead of searching for an Act of Congress displacing state authority, our cases require a search for federal legislation conferring state authority:  [U]nless and until Congress acts, the tribes retain their historic sovereign authority.  Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S., at 788 (internal quotation marks omitted); see United States v. Cooley, 593 U.S. ___, ______ (2021) (slip op., at 34) (instructing courts to ask if a treaty or statute has explicitly divested Indian tribes of the ... authority at issue); Anderson 317.  What is more, courts must tread lightly before concluding Congress has abrogated tribal sovereignty in favor of state authority.  Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S., at 60.  Any ambiguities in   Congresss work must be resolved in favor of tribal sovereignty and against state power.  See ibid.; see also Cotton Petroleum, 490 U.S., at 177.  And, if anything, these rules bear special force in the criminal context, which lies at the heart of tribal sovereignty and in which Congress has provided a nearly comprehensive set of statutes allocating criminal jurisdiction among federal, tribal, and state authorities.  Cohen 527.[3] B From 1834 to 1968, Congress adopted a series of laws governing criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands.  Those laws are many, detailed, and clear.  Each operates against the backdrop understanding that Tribes are sovereign and that in our constitutional order only Congress may displace their authority.  Nor does anything in Congresss work begin to confer on Oklahoma the authority it seeks. 1 Start with the GCA, first adopted by Congress in 1834 and most recently reenacted in 1948.  The GCA provides: Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, except the District of Columbia, shall extend to Indian Country.  This section shall not extend to offenses committed by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian, nor to any Indian committing any offense in the Indian country who has been punished by the local law of the tribe, or to any case where, by treaty stipulations, the exclusive jurisdiction over such offenses is or may be secured to the Indian tribes respectively. 18 U.S.C. 1152. As recounted above, Congress adopted the GCA in the aftermath of Worcesters holding that the federal government alone may regulate tribal affairs and States do not possess inherent authority to apply their criminal laws on tribal lands.  Responding to that decision, Congress did not choose to exercise its authority to allow state jurisdiction on tribal lands.  Far from it.  Congress chose only to extend federal law to tribal landsand even then only for certain crimes involving non-Indian settlers.  Otherwise, Congress recognized, those settlers might be subject to tribal criminal jurisdiction alone.  See Part IB, supra.  Several features of the law confirm this understanding.  Take just three. First, the GCA compares Indian country to place[s] within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.   1152.  The latter category refers to federal enclaves like national parks and military bases that the Constitution places under exclusive federal control.  See Art. I, 8, cl. 17; United States v. Cowboy, 694 F.2d 1228, 1234 (CA10 1982); see also Exparte Crow Dog,\\n\\n109 U.S. 556, 567 (1883).  And state laws generally do not apply in federal enclaves.  See, e.g., Fort Leavenworth R.Co. v. Lowe,\\n\\n114 U.S. 525, 532533 (1885).  Rather than unambiguously endow States with any sort of prosecutorial authority on tribal lands, the GCA thus makes plain that tribal lands are to be treated like federal enclaves subject to federal, not state, control. Second, the GCA provides that the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses shall apply on tribal lands.   1152.  Again, nothing here purports to extend state criminal laws to tribal lands.  Quite the contrary.  It would hardly make sense to apply federal general criminal lawto address all crimes ranging from murder to jaywalkingif state general criminal law already did the job.  Traditionally, this Court does not assume multiple sets of [general] criminal laws apply to those subject to federal protection.  Lewis v. United States,\\n\\n523 U.S. 155, 163 (1998).  Instead, when Congress converts an area into a federal enclave, we usually presume later-enacted state law does not apply.  Parker Drilling Management Services, Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at9). Third, after applying the federal governments general criminal laws to tribal lands, the GCA carves out some exceptions.  It provides that federal law shall not extend to crimes involving only Indians, crimes by Indians where the perpetrator has been punished by the local law of the tribe, or where a treaty grants a Tribe exclusive jurisdiction.   1152.  These exceptions ensure that the federal government does not meddle in cases most likely to implicate tribal sovereignty.  And it defies the imagination to think Congress would have taken such care to limit federal authority over these most sensitive cases while (somewhere, somehow) leaving States, so often the Tribes deadliest enemies, to enjoy free rein.  United States v. Kagama,\\n\\n118 U.S. 375, 384 (1886). 2 When Congress enacted the MCA in 1885, it proceeded once more against the backdrop rule that only tribal criminal law applies on tribal lands, that States enjoy no inherent authority to prosecute cases on tribal lands, and that only Congress may displace tribal power.  Nor, once more, did Congresss new legislation purport to allow States to prosecute crimes on tribal lands.  In response to concerns with how tribal authorities were handling major crimes committed by tribal members, in the MCA Congress took a step beyond the GCA and instructed that, in the future, the federal government would have exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute certain crimes by Indian defendants on tribal lands.  18 U.S.C. 1153(a); see also Part IB, supra.  Here again, Congresss work hardly would have been necessary or made sense if States already possessed jurisdiction to try crimes by or against Indians on tribal reservations.  Plainly, Congresss purpose in adopting the MCA was to answer the objection that major crimes by tribal members on tribal lands would otherwise be subject to prosecution by tribal authorities alone.  See Kagama, 118 U.S., at 383385. 3 Consider next the Treaty of New Echota and the Oklahoma Enabling Act.  In 1835, the United States entered into a treaty with the Cherokee.  In that treaty, the Nation promised that, within a new reservation in what was to become Oklahoma, the Tribe would enjoy the right to govern itself and remain forever free from State sovereignties and the jurisdiction of any State.  Treaty with the Cherokee, Preamble,\\n\\n7Stat.\\n478.  This Court has instructed that tribal treaties must be interpreted as they would naturally be understood by the Indians at ratification.  Herrera v. Wyoming, 587 U.S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 19) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And having just lost their traditional homelands to Georgia, who can doubt that the Cherokee understood this promise as a guarantee that they would retain their sovereign authority over crimes by or against tribal members subject only to federal, not state, law?  That was certainly the contemporaneous understanding of the House Committee on Indian Affairs, which observed that [t]he United States and the Indian tribes [would be] the sole parties with power over new reservations in the West.  H. Rep. No. 474, at 18; see also Part IB, supra.  This Court has long shared the same view.  By treaties and statutes, the Court has said, the right of the Cherokee [N]ation to exist as an autonomous body, subject always to the paramount authority of the United States, has been recognized.  Talton v. Mayes,\\n\\n163 U.S. 376, 379380 (1896).[4] In 1906, Congress sought to deliver on its treaty promises when it adopted the Oklahoma Enabling Act.  That law paved the way for the new States admission to the Union.  But in doing so, Congress took care to require Oklahoma to agree and declare that it would forever disclaim all right and title in or to ... all lands lying within [the States] limits owned or held by any Indian, tribe, or nation.\\n\\n34Stat.\\n270.  Instead of granting the State some new power to prosecute crimes by or against tribal members, Congress insisted that tribal lands shall be and remain subject to the jurisdiction, disposal, and control of the United States.  Ibid.  Oklahoma complied with Congresss instructions by adopting both of these commitments verbatim in its Constitution.  Art. I,  3. Underscoring the nature of this arrangement, the Enabling Act further provided that nothing contained in the [Oklahoma] constitution shall be construed ... to limit or affect the authority of the Government of the United States to make any law or regulation respecting such Indians, their lands, property, or other rights by treaties, agreement, law, or otherwise, which it would have been competent to make if this Act had never been passed.\\n\\n34Stat.\\n267268 (emphasis added).  Prior to statehood, too, no one could have questioned Congresss exclusive authority to regulate tribal lands and affairs in the Oklahoma territory.  See, e.g., U.S. Const., Art.IV; Kagama, 118 U.S., at 380 (citing federal governments exclusive sovereignty over federal territories); Simms v. Simms,\\n\\n175 U.S. 162, 168 (1899) (In the Territories of the United States, Congress has the entire dominion and sovereignty, ... Federal and state); Harjo v. Kleppe, 420 F. Supp. 1110, 1121 (DC 1976) (federal courts had pre-statehood jurisdiction); Clinton 960962.  The Oklahoma Enabling Act and the commitments it demanded in the new Oklahoma Constitution sought to maintain this status quo. Recognizing the point, this Court has explained that, [i]n passing the enabling act for the admission of the State of Oklahoma ... Congress was careful to preserve the authority of the Government of the United States over the Indians, their lands and property, which it had prior to the passage of the act.  Tiger v. Western Investment Co.,\\n\\n221 U.S. 286, 309 (1911) (emphasis added).  This Court has explained, too, that the grant of statehood to Oklahoma did nothing to disturb the long-settled rule that the guardianship of the United States over Native American Tribes in Oklahoma has not been abandoned.  United States v. Ramsey,\\n\\n271 U.S. 467, 469 (1926).  Instead, this Court has acknowledged, the federal governments authority in respect of crimes committed by or against Indians continued after the admission of the state as it was before.  Ibid.  In fact, the Court has long interpreted nearly identical language in the Arizona Enabling Actenacted close in time to its Oklahoma counterpartas reinforcing the traditional rule that the States lac[k] jurisdiction on tribal lands over crimes by or against Native Americans.  McClanahan, 411 U.S., at 175; see also Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Commn,\\n\\n380 U.S. 685, 687, n. 3 (1965).[5] 4 The few occasions on which Congress has even arguably authorized the application of state criminal law on tribal reservations still do not come anywhere near granting Oklahoma the power it seeks.  In the late 1800s, this Court in McBratney and Draper held that federal statutes admitting certain States to the Union effectively meant those States could now prosecute crimes on tribal lands involving only non-Indians.  Yet, as aggressive as these decisions were, they took care to safeguard the rule that a States admission to the Union does not convey with it the power to punish crimes committed by or against Indians.  McBratney, 104 U.S., at 624; Draper, 164 U.S., at 247.  Indeed, soon after Oklahoma became a State, this Court explained that the grant of statehood may have endowed Oklahoma with authority to try crimes not committed by or against Indians, but with statehood did not come any authority to try crimes by or against Indians on tribal lands.  Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469; see also n.5, supra; Donnelly v. United States,\\n\\n228 U.S. 243, 271 (1913); Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S., at 220; Cohen 506509.  The decision whether and when this arrangement should cease rest[ed] with Congress alone.  Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469. The truth is, Congress has authorized the application of state criminal law on tribal lands for offenses committed by or against Native Americans only in very limited circumstances.  The most notable examples can be found in Public Law 280 and related statutes.  In 1940, Kansas successfully lobbied Congress for criminal jurisdiction in Indian country.  Nearly identical laws for North Dakota, Iowa, and New York followed close behind.  Then in 1953, Congress adopted Public Law 280 in which it authorized five States to exercise criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands and established procedures for additional States to assume similar authority.  In 1968, Congress amended Public Law 280.  Now, before a State like Oklahoma may try crimes by or against Native Americans arising on tribal lands, it must take action to amend any state law disclaiming that authority; then, the State must seek and obtain tribal consent to any extension of state jurisdiction.  See Part IB, supra; Clinton 958962.  Unless a State takes these steps, it does not hav[e] jurisdiction.  25 U.S.C. 1321(a), 1323(b).[6] 5 The Courts suggestion that Oklahoma enjoys inherent authority to try crimes against Native Americans within the Cherokee Reservation makes a mockery of all of Congresss work from 1834 to 1968.  The GCA and MCA?  On the Courts account, Congress foolishly extended federal criminal law to tribal lands on a mistaken assumption that only tribal law would otherwise apply.  Unknown to anyone until today, state law applied all along.  The treaty, the Oklahoma Enabling Act, and the provision in Oklahomas constitution that Congress insisted upon as a condition of statehood?  The Court effectively ignores them.  The Kansas Act and its sibling statutes?  On the Courts account, they were needless too.  Congresss instruction in Public Law 280 that States may not exercise jurisdiction over crimes by or against tribal members on tribal lands until they amend contrary state law and obtain tribal consent?  Once more, it seems the Court thinks Congress was hopelessly misguided.   Through it all, the Court makes no effort to grapple with the backdrop rule of tribal sovereignty.  The Court proceeds oblivious to the rule that only a clear act of Congress may impose constraints on tribal sovereignty.  The Court ignores the fact that Congress has never come close to subjecting the Cherokee to state criminal jurisdiction over crimes against tribal members within the Tribes reservation.  The Court even disregards our precedents recognizing that the grant of statehood to Oklahoma did not endow the State with any power to try crimes committed by or against Indians on tribal lands but reserved that authority to the federal government and Tribes alone.  Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469; see also Tiger, 221 U.S., at 309.  From start to finish, the Court defies our duty to interpret Congresss laws and our own prior work harmoniously as part of an entire corpus juris.  A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 252 (2012); see also Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller,\\n\\n486 U.S. 174, 184185 (1988). C Putting aside these astonishing errors, Congresss work and this Courts precedents yield three clear principles that firmly resolve this case.  First, tribal sovereign authority excludes the operation of other sovereigns criminal laws unless and until Congress ordains otherwise.  Second, while Congress has extended a good deal of federal criminal law to tribal lands, in Oklahoma it has authorized the State to prosecute crimes by or against Native Americans within tribal boundaries only if it satisfies certain requirements.  Under Public Law 280, the State must remove state-law barriers to jurisdiction and obtain tribal consent.  Third, because Oklahoma has done neither of these things, it lacks the authority it seeks to try crimes against tribal members within a tribal reservation.  Until today, all this settled law was well appreciated by this Court, the Executive Branch, and even Oklahoma. Consider first our own precedents and those of other courts.  In 1946 in Williams v. United States, this Court recognized that, while States may have jurisdiction over offenses committed on th[e] reservation between persons who are not Indians, the laws and courts of the United States, rather than those of [the States], have jurisdiction over offenses committed there ... by one who is not an Indian against one who is an Indian.\\n\\n327 U.S. 711, 714 (footnote omitted).  In Williams v. Lee, issued in 1959, this Court was clear again: [I]f the crime was by or against an Indian, tribal jurisdiction or that expressly conferred on other courts by Congress has remained exclusive.  358 U.S., at 220.  As early as 1926, this Court made the same point while speaking directly to Oklahoma.  Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469470.  It is a point our cases have continued to make in recent years.[7]  It is a point a host of other courtsincluding state courts issuing decisions contrary to their own interestshave acknowledged too.[8] The Executive Branch has likewise understood the States to lack authority to try crimes by or against Indians in Indian country absent congressional authorization.  Not only did the Washington Administration recognize as much.  See Part IA, supra.  The same view has persisted throughout the Nations history.  In 1940, the Acting Secretary of the Interior advised Congress that state criminal jurisdiction extends only to situations where both the offender and the victim are non-Indians.  S.Rep. No. 1523, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 2 (Vol. 2).  A few decades later, the Solicitor General made a similar representation to this Court.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Arizona v. Flint, O. T.   1988, No. 88603, p.3 (Flint Amicus Brief).  In McGirt, the federal government once more acknowledged that States cannot prosecute crimes by or against tribal members within still-extant tribal reservations.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in McGirt v. Oklahoma, O. T. 2019, No. 189526, p.38.  In this case, the government has espoused the same view yet again.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4; see also Dept. of Justice, Criminal Resource Manual 685 (updated Jan. 22, 2020).[9] In the past, even Oklahoma has more or less conceded the point.  The last time Oklahoma was before us, it asked this Court to usurp congressional authority and disestablish the Creek Reservation because, otherwise, the State would not have jurisdiction over crimes committed against Indians within its boundaries.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. in McGirt v. Oklahoma, No. 189526, O. T. 2019, p. 54; see also McGirt, 591 U.S., at ______ (slip op., at 3738).  In 1991, Oklahomas attorney general formally resolved that major [c]rimes committed by or against Indians ... are under the exclusive province of the United States, while Tribes retain exclusive jurisdiction over minor crimes committed by Indians.  Haney, 22 Okla. Opp. Atty. Gen. 71, 1991 WL 567868, *3. And Oklahomas own courts have recently taken the same position even in the face of vehement opposition from the States executive branch.  See, e.g., Spears, 485 P.3d, at 875, 877. D Against all this evidence, what is the Courts reply?  It acknowledges that, at the Nations founding, tribal sovereignty precluded States from prosecuting crimes on tribal lands by or against tribal members without congressional authorization.  See ante, at 5.  But the Court suggests this traditional notion flipped 180 degrees sometime in the latter half of the 1800s.  Ante, at 5, 21.  Since then, the Court says, Oklahoma has enjoyed the inherent power to try at least crimes by non-Indians against tribal members on tribal reservations until and unless Congress preempts state authority. But exactly when and how did this change happen?  The Court never explains.  Instead, the Court seeks to cast blame for its ruling on a grab bag of decisions issued by our predecessors.  But the failure of that effort is transparent.  Start with McBratney, which the Court describes as our leading case in the criminal context.  Ante, at 6.  There, as we have seen, the Court said that States admitted to the Union may gain the right to prosecute cases involving only non-Indians on tribal lands, but they do not gain any inherent right to punish crimes committed by or against Indians on tribal lands.  McBratney, 104 U.S., at 624.  The Courts reliance on Draper fares no better, for that case issued a similar disclaimer.  See 164 U.S., at 247.  Tellingly, not even Oklahoma thinks McBratney and Draper compel a ruling in its favor.  See Brief for Petitioner 12.  And if anything, the Courts invocation of Donnelly,\\n\\n228 U.S. 243, is more baffling still.  Ante, at 14, n.3. There, the Court once more reaffirmed the rule that offenses committed by or against Indians on tribal lands remain subject to federal, not state, jurisdiction.  Donnelly, 228 U.S., at 271; see also Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469. That leaves the Court to assemble a string of carefully curated snippetsa clause here, a sentence therefrom six decisions out of the galaxy of this Courts Indian law jurisprudence.  Ante, at 56.  But this collection of cases is no more at fault for the Courts decision than the last.  Organized Village of Kake v. Eganwhich the Court seems to think is some magic bullet, see ante, at 5, 14, n.2, 21, 2224addressed the prosaic question whether Alaska could apply its fishing laws on lands owned by a native Alaska tribal corporation.\\n\\n369 U.S. 60, 6163 (1962); see also n.5, supra.  Subsequently, the Court cabined that case to circumstances dealing with Indians who have left or never inhabited reservations set aside for their exclusive use or who do not possess the usual accoutrements of tribal self-government.  McClanahan, 411 U.S., at 167168.  Meanwhile, New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble allowed New York to use civil proceedings to eject non-Indian trespassers on Indian lands.  21 How. 366, 369371 (1859).  In Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook, the crime at issue did not take place on tribal lands but on a supply station of the United States sold by Arkansas to the federal government.\\n\\n281 U.S. 647, 649 (1930).  In New York exrel. Ray v. Martin, this Court merely reaffirmed McBratney and held that States could exercise jurisdiction over crimes involving only non-Indians.\\n\\n326 U.S. 496, 499500 (1946). Both County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation and Nevada v. Hicks issued holdings about state civil jurisdiction, not criminal jurisdiction striking at the heart of tribal sovereignty.  See\\n\\n502 U.S. 251, 256258, 270 (1992);\\n\\n533 U.S. 353, 361, 363, 374 (2001). In the end, the Court cannot fault our predecessors for todays decision.  The blame belongs only with this Court here and now.  Standing before us is a mountain of statutes and precedents making plain that Oklahoma possesses no authority to prosecute crimes against tribal members on tribal reservations until it amends its laws and wins tribal consent.  This Court may choose to ignore Congresss statutes and the Nations treaties, but it has no power to negate them.  The Court may choose to disregard our precedents, but it does not purport to overrule a single one.  As a result, todays decision surely marks an embarrassing new entry into the anticanon of Indian law.  But its mistakes need notand should notbe repeated. III Doubtless for some of these reasons, even the Court ultimately abandons its suggestion that Oklahoma is inherent[ly] free to prosecute crimes by non-Indians against tribal members on a tribal reservation absent a federal statute preempt[ing] its authority.  Ante, at 15.  In the end, the Court admits that tribal sovereignty can require the exclusion of state authority even absent a preemptive federal statute.  Ante, at 18.  But then, after correcting course, the Court veers off once more.  To determine whether tribal sovereignty displaces state authority in a case involving a non-Indian defendant and an Indian victim on a reservation in Oklahoma, the Court resorts to a Bracker balancing test.  Ibid.  Applying that test, the Court concludes that Oklahomas interests in this case outweigh those of the Cherokee.  All this, too, is mistaken root and branch. A Begin with the most fundamental problem. The Court invokes what it calls the Bracker balancing test with no more appreciation of that decisions history and context than it displays in its initial suggestion that the usual rules of preemption apply to Tribes.  The Court tells us nothing about Bracker itself, its reasoning, or its limits.  Perhaps understandably so, for Bracker never purported to claim for this Court the raw power to balance away tribal sovereignty in favor of state criminal jurisdiction over crimes by or against tribal memberslet alone ordain a wholly different set of jurisdictional rules than Congress already has. Bracker involved a relatively minor civil dispute.  Arizona sought to tax vehicles used by the White Mountain Apache Tribe in logging operations on tribal lands.  See Bracker, 448 U.S., at 138140.  The Tribe opposed the effort, pointing to a federal law that regulated tribal logging but did not say anything about preempting the States vehicle tax.  See id., at 141, 145.  The Court began by recognizing that the usual rules of preemption are not properly applied to Tribes.  Id., at 143.  Instead, the Court started with the traditional backdrop presumption that States lack jurisdiction in Indian country.  Ibid.  And the Court explained that any ambiguities about the scope of federal law must be construed generously in favor of the Tribes as sovereigns.  Id., at 143144.  With these rules in mind, the Court proceeded to turn back the States tax based on a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state, federal, and tribal interests at stake.  Id., at 145.  The Court judged that traditional notions of [tribal] sovereignty, the federal governments policy of promoting tribal self-sufficiency, and the rule requiring it to resolve [a]mbiguities in favor of the Tribe trumped any competing state interest.  Id., at 143144, 151. Nothing in any of this gets the Court close to where it wishes to go.  If Arizona had to proceed against the traditional backdrop rule excluding state jurisdiction, Oklahoma must.  And if Arizona could not overcome that backdrop rule because it could not point to clear federal statutory language authorizing its comparatively minor civil tax, it is unfathomable how Oklahoma might overcome that rule here.  The State has pointedand can pointto nothing in Congresss work granting it the power to try crimes against tribal members on a tribal reservation.  In Bracker, the Court found it instructive that Congress had comprehensive[ly] regulated the harvesting of Indian timber, even if it had not spoken directly to the question of vehicle taxes.  Id., at 145146, 148.  Here, Congress has not only pervasively regulated criminal jurisdiction in Indian country, it has spoken to the very situation we face:  States like Oklahoma may exercise jurisdiction over crimes within tribal boundaries by or against tribal members only with tribal consent. The simple truth is Bracker supplies zero authority for this Courts course today.  If Congress has not always been specific about the allocation of civil jurisdiction in Indian country, the same can hardly be said about the allocation of criminal authority.  Cohen 527.  Congress has provided a nearly comprehensive set of statutes allocating criminal jurisdiction.  Ibid.  In doing so, Congress has already balanced competing tribal, state, and federal interestsand its balance demands tribal consent.  Exactly nothing in Bracker permits us to ignore Congresss directive. B Plainly, the Courts balancing-test game is not one we should be playing in this case.  But what if we did?  Suppose this Court could (somehow) ignore Congresss decision to allow States like Oklahoma to exercise criminal jurisdiction in cases like ours only with tribal consent.  Suppose we could (somehow) replace that rule with one of our own creation.  Even proceeding on that stunning premise, it is far from obvious how the Court arrives at its preferred result. In reweighing competing state and tribal interests for itself, the Court stresses two points.  First, the Court suggests that its balance is designed to help Native Americans.  Ante, at 20 (suggesting that Indians would be second-class citizens without this Courts intervention); Tr. of Oral Arg. 66 (suggesting state jurisdiction is designed to help tribal members). Second, the Court says state jurisdiction is needed on the Cherokee Reservation today because in the wake of McGirt some defendants have simply gone free.  Ante, at 34.  On both counts, however, the Court conspicuously loads the dice. 1 Start with the assertion that allowing state prosecutions in cases like ours will help Indians.  The old paternalist overtones are hard to ignore.  Yes, under the laws Congress has ordained Oklahoma may acquire jurisdiction over crimes by or against tribal members only with tribal consent.  But to date, the Cherokee have misguidedly shown no interest in state jursidiction.  Thanks to their misjudgment, they have rendered themselves second-class citizens.  Ante, at 20. So, the argument goes, five unelected judges in Washington must now make the right choice for the Tribe.  To state the Courts staggering argument should be enough to refute it. Nor does the Court even pause to consider some of the reasons why the Cherokee might not be so eager to invite state prosecutions in cases like ours.  Maybe the Cherokee have so far withheld their consent because, throughout the Nations history, state governments have sometimes proven less than reliable sources of justice for Indian victims.  As early as 1795, George Washington observed that a Jury on the frontiers considering a crime by a non-Indian against an Indian could hardly be got to listen to a charge, much less to convict a culprit.  Letter to E. Pendleton (Jan. 22), in 17 Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 424, 426 (D. Hoth & C. Ebel eds. 2013).  Undoubtedly, too, Georgia once proved among the Cherokees deadliest enemies.  Kagama, 118 U.S., at 384. Maybe the Cherokee also have in mind experiences particular to Oklahoma.  Following statehood, settlers embarked on elaborate schemes to deprive Indians of their lands, rents, and mineral rights.  Many young allottees were virtually kidnaped just before they reached their majority; some were induced to sign deeds at midnight on the morning they became of age.  Debo 197198.  Others were subjected to predatory guardianships; state judges even reward[ed] their supporters [with] guardianship appointments.  Id., at 183.  Oklahomas courts also sometimes sanctioned the legalized robbery of these Native American children through the probate courts.  Id., at 182.  Even almost a century on, the federal government warned of the possibility of prejudice [against Native Americans] in state courts.  Flint Amicus Brief 5. Whatever may have happened in the past, it seems the Court can imagine only a bright new day ahead.  Moving forward, the Court cheerily promises, more prosecuting authorities can only help.  Three sets of prosecutorsfederal, tribal, and stateare sure to prove better than two.  But again its not hard to imagine reasons why the Cherokee might see things differently.  If more sets of prosecutors are always better, why not allow Texas to enforce its laws in California?  Few sovereigns or their citizens would see that as an improvement.  Yet it seems the Court cannot grasp why the Tribe may not. The Court also neglects to consider actual experience with concurrent state jurisdiction on tribal lands.  According to a group of former United States Attorneys, in practice concurrent jurisdiction has sometimes create[d] a pass-the-buck dynamic ... with the end result being fewer police and more crime.  Brief for Former United States Attorneys etal. as Amici Curiae 13; see also C. Goldberg, Public Law 280: The Limits of State Jurisdiction Over Reservation Indians, 22 UCLA L. Rev. 535, 552, and n.92 (1975); Goldberg-Ambrose 1423.  Federal authorities may reduce their involvement when state authorities are present.  In turn, some States may not wish to devote the resources required and may view the responsibility as an unfunded federal mandate.  Thanks to realities like these, [a]lmost as soon as Congress began granting States [criminal] jurisdiction through Public Law 280, affected Tribal Nations began seeking retrocession and repeal.  Brief for National Indigenous Womens Resource Center et al. as Amici Curiae 12.  Recently, a bipartisan congressional commission agreed that more state criminal jurisdiction in Indian country is often not a good policy choice.  See Indian Law and Order Commission, A Roadmap for Making Native America Safer: Report to the President and Congress of the United States xi, xiv, 1115 (Nov. 2013).  Still, none of this finds its way into the Courts cost-benefit analysis. 2 Instead, the Court marches on.  The second factor it weighs in its balanceand the only history it seems interested in consultingconcerns Oklahomas account of its experiences in the last two years since McGirt.  Adopting the States representations wholesale, the Court says that decision has posed Oklahoma with law-and-order challenge[s].  Ante, at 4.  To support its thesis, the Court cites the States unsubstantiated estimat[e] that McGirt has forced it to transfer prosecutorial responsibility for more than 18,000 cases per year to federal and tribal authorities.  Ibid.  Apparently on the belief that the transfer of cases from state to federal prosecutors equates to an eruption of chaos and criminality, the Court remarks casually that traditional limitations on state prosecutorial authority on tribal lands were insignificant in the real world before McGirt.  Ante, at 16. But what does this prove?  Put aside for the moment questions about the accuracy of Oklahomas statistics and what the number of cases transferred from state to federal prosecutors may or may not mean for law and order.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26 (questioning whether the States figures might be grossly exaggerated).  Taking the Courts account at face value, it might amount to a reason for Oklahoma to lobby the Cherokee to consent to state jurisdiction.  It might be a reason for the State to petition Congress to revise criminal jurisdictional arrangements in the State even without tribal consent.  But it is no act of statutory or constitutional interpretation.  It is a policy argument through and through. Nor is the Courts policy argument exactly complete in its assessment of the costs and benefits.  When this Court issued McGirt, it expressly acknowledged that cases involving crimes by or against tribal members within reservation boundaries would have to be transferred from state to tribal or federal authorities.  591 U.S., at ______ (slip op., at 3642).  This Court anticipated, too, that this process would require a period of readjustment.  But, the Court recognized, all this was necessary only because Oklahoma had long overreached its authority on tribal reservations and defied legally binding congressional promises.  See ibid. Notably, too, neither the tribal nor the federal authorities on the receiving end of this new workload think the costs of this period of readjustment begin to justify the Courts course.  For their part, Tribes in Oklahoma have hired more police officers, prosecutors, and judges.  See Cherokee Brief 1011.  Based on that investment, Oklahomas Tribes have begun to prosecute substantially more cases than they once did.  See id., at 1213.  And they have also shown a willingness to work with Oklahoma, having signed hundreds of cross-deputization agreements allowing local law enforcement to collaborate with tribal police.  Id., at 1516, and n.39.  Even Oklahomas amici concede these agreements have proved an important tool for law enforcement.  Brief for Oklahoma District Attorneys Association etal. as Amici Curiae 14. Both of the federal governments elected branches have also responded, if not in the way this Court happens to prefer.  Instead of forcing state criminal jurisdiction onto Tribes, Congress has chosen to allocate additional funds for law enforcement in Oklahoma.  See, e.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, H.R. 2471, 117th Cong., 2d Sess., 78 (2022).  Meanwhile, the Solicitor General has offered the Executive Branchs judgment that McGirts practical consequences do not justify this Courts intervention, explaining that the Department of Justice is working diligently with tribal and State partners in Oklahoma.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 32. There is even more evidence cutting against the Courts dystopian tale.  According to a recent United States Attorney in Oklahoma, the sky isnt falling and partnerships between tribal law enforcement and state law enforcement are strong.  A.Herrera, Trent Shores Reflects on His Time as U.S. Attorney, Remains Committed to Justice for Indian Country, KOSU-NPR (Feb. 24, 2021), www.kosu.org/politics/2021-02-24/trent-shores-reflects-on-his-time-as-u-s-attorney-remains-committed-to-justice-for-indian-country.  A Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent in charge of Oklahoma has stated that violent crimes are being pursued as heavily as they were in the past, and in some cases, maybe even stronger.  A. Brothers, Oklahoma Special Agent Says FBI Faces Challenges in 3 Categories, News on 6 (Feb. 14, 2022),https://www.newson6.com/story/620b261bf8cd4a07e5cb845b/oklahoma-special-agent-says-fbi-faces-challenges-in-3-categories.  And the Tribesthose most affected by all this supposed lawlessness within their reservationstell us that, after a period of adjustment, federal prosecutors are now pursuing lower level offenses vigorously too.  See Brief for Muscogee (Creek) Nation as Amicus Curiae on Pet. for Cert. 1112, and nn.2122 (collecting indictments).  The federal government has made a similar representation to this Court.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 118.  Nor is it any secret that those convicted of federal crimes generally receive longer sentences than individuals convicted of similar state offenses.  See, e.g., Bureau of Justice Statistics, Felony Sentences in State Courts, 2006Statistical Tables 9 (2009) (Table 1.6). In recounting all this, I do not profess certainty about the optimal law enforcement arrangements in Oklahoma.  I do not pretend to know all the relevant facts, let alone how to balance each of them in this complex picture.  Nor do I claim to know what weight to give historical wrongs or future hopes.  I offer the preceding observations only to illustrate the one thing I am sure of:  This Court has no business usurping congressional decisions about the appropriate balance between federal, tribal, and state interests.  If the Courts ruling today sounds like a legislative committee report touting the benefits of some newly proposed bill, thats because it is exactly that.  And given that a nine-member court is a poor substitute for the peoples elected representatives, it is no surprise that the Courts cost-benefit analysis is radically incomplete.  The Courts decision is not a judicial interpretation of the laws meaning; it is the pastiche of a legislative process. C As unsound as the Courts decision is, it would be a mistake to overlook its limits.  In the end, the Court admits that tribal sovereignty can displace state authority even without a preemptive statute.  See Part IIIA, supra.  To be sure, the Court proceeds to disparage a federal statute requiring Oklahoma to obtain tribal consent before trying any crime involving an Indian victim within the Cherokee Reservation.  But look at what the Court leaves unresolved.  The Court does not pass on Public Law 280s provision that States shall not be entitled to assume jurisdiction on tribal lands until they appropriately amen[d] state laws disclaiming authority over tribal reservations.\\n\\n25 U.S.C.  1324.  The Court gestures toward the Cherokees treaties and the Oklahoma Enabling Act, but ultimately abandons any argument that those treaties were lawfully abrogated or that the Oklahoma Enabling Act endowed Oklahoma with inherent authority to try cases involving Native Americans within tribal bounds.  See ante, at 18. Nor does the Court address the relevant text of those treaties or the Enabling Actlet alone come to terms with our precedents holding that Oklahomas grant of statehood did not include the power to try crimes committed by or against Indians on tribal lands.  Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469; see also Tiger, 221 U.S., at 309.  Nothing in todays decision could or does begin to preclude the Cherokee or other Tribes from pressing arguments along any of these lines in future cases.  The unamended Oklahoma Constitution and other state statutes and judicial decisions may stand as independent barriers to the assumption of state jurisdiction as a matter of state law too. The Courts decision is limited in still other important ways.  Most significantly, the Court leaves undisturbed the ancient rule that States cannot prosecute crimes by Native Americans on tribal lands without clear congressional authorizationfor that would touch the heart of tribal self-government.  Ante, at 17.  At least that rule (and maybe others) can never be balanced away.  Indeed, the Courts ruling today rests in significant part on the fact that Tribes currently lack criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians who commit crimes on tribal landsa factor that obviously does not apply to cases involving Native American defendants.  Ante, at 19. Additionally, nothing in the Bracker balancing test the Court employs foreordains todays grim result for different Tribes in different States.  Bracker instructs courts to focus on the specific context at issue, taking cognizance of the particular circumstances of the Tribe in question, including all relevant treaties and statutes.  448 U.S., at 145.  Nor are Tribes and their treaties fungible.  S.Prakash, Against Tribal Fungibility, 89 Cornell L. Rev. 1069, 10711072 (2004).  There are nearly 600 federally recognized Indian Tribes across the country.  See Anderson 3.  Some of their treaties appear to promise tribal freedom from state criminal jurisdiction in express terms.  See, e.g., Treaty with the Navajo, Art. I, June 1868,\\n\\n15Stat.\\n667 (guaranteeing that those who commit crimes against tribal members will be arrested and punished according to the laws of the United States).  Any analysis true to Bracker must take cognizance of all of this.  Any such analysis must recognize, too, that the standards of preemption applicable in other areas of the law are unhelpful when it comes to Tribes.  Bracker, 448 U.S., at 143.  Instead, courts must proceed against the backdrop of tribal sovereignty, ibid., with an assumption that the States have no power to regulate the affairs of Indians on a reservation or other tribal lands, Williams, 358 U.S., at 219220.  To overcome that backdrop assumption, a clear congressional statement is required and any ambiguities must be construed generously in favor of the Tribes.  Bracker, 448 U.S., at 143144; see also Cotton Petroleum, 490 U.S., at 177178.  The Court today may ignore a clear jurisdictional rule prescribed by statute and choose to apply its own balancing test instead.  The Court may misapply that balancing test in an effort to address one States professed law and order concerns.  In the process, the Court may even risk unsettling longstanding and clear jurisdictional rules nationwide.  But in the end, any faithful application of Bracker to other Tribes in other States should only confirm the soundness of the traditional rule that state authorities may not try crimes like this one absent congressional authorization.[10] Nor must Congress stand by as this Court sows needless confusion across the country.  Even the Court acknowledges that Congress can undo its decision and preempt state authority at any time.  Ante, at 6.  And Congress could do exactly that with a simple amendment to Public Law 280.  It might say:  A State lacks criminal jurisdiction over crimes by or against Indians in Indian Country, unless the State complies with the procedures to obtain tribal consent outlined in\\n\\n25 U.S.C.  1321, and, where necessary, amends its constitution or statutes pursuant to\\n\\n25 U.S.C.  1324.  Of course, that reminder of the obvious should hardly be necessary.  But thanks to this Courts egregious misappropriation of legislative authority, the ball is back in Congress court.  Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.,\\n\\n550 U.S. 618, 661 (2007) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). * In the 1830s, this Court struggled to keep our Nations promises to the Cherokee.  Justice Story celebrated the decision in Worcester: [T]hanks be to God, the Court can wash [its] hands clean of the iniquity of oppressing the Indians and disregarding their rights.  Breyer 420.  The Court had done its duty, even if Georgia refused to do its own.  Ibid.  Today, the tables turn.  Oklahomas courts exercised the fortitude to stand athwart their own States lawless disregard of the Cherokees sovereignty.  Now, at the bidding of Oklahomas executive branch, this Court unravels those lower-court decisions, defies Congresss statutes requiring tribal consent, offers its own consent in place of the Tribes, and allows Oklahoma to intrude on a feature of tribal sovereignty recognized since the founding.  One can only hope the political branches and future courts will do their duty to honor this Nations promises even as we have failed today to do our own.']\n","\n","Justia_auth_txt ['Syllabus &&& Opinion (Kavanaugh) &&& Dissent (Gorsuch)']\n","\n"]}],"source":["# checking first case as an example\n","for col in oyez.columns:\n","    print(col, oyez.head(1)[col].values)\n","    print()"],"id":"fe601a28"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":15,"status":"ok","timestamp":1665578676129,"user":{"displayName":"Yoon Tae Park","userId":"09999553679903486983"},"user_tz":240},"id":"e069256e","outputId":"e9395fa9-e072-4219-c658-9dff81658098","scrolled":true},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["['NOTE:Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.

Castro-Huerta certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of oklahoma No. 21429.Argued April 27, 2022Decided June 29, 2022 In 2015, respondent Victor Manuel Castro-Huerta was charged by the State of Oklahoma for child neglect.  Castro-Huerta was convicted in state court and sentenced to 35 years of imprisonment.  While Castro-Huertas state-court appeal was pending, this Court decided McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U.S. ___.  There, the Court held that the Creek Nations reservation in eastern Oklahoma had never been properly disestablished and therefore remained Indian country.  Id., at ___.  In light of McGirt, the eastern part of Oklahoma, including Tulsa, is recognized as Indian country.  Following this development, Castro-Huerta argued that the Federal Government had exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute him (a non-Indian) for a crime committed against his stepdaughter (a Cherokee Indian) in Tulsa (Indian country), and that the State therefore lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him.  The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals agreed and vacated his conviction.  This Court granted certiorari to determine the extent of a States jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. Held:The Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  Pp.425. (a)The jurisdictional dispute in this case arises because Oklahomas territory includes Indian country.  In the early Republic, the Federal Government sometimes treated Indian country as separate from state territory.  See Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515.  But that view has long since been abandoned. Organized Village of Kake v. Egan,\\n369 U.S. 60, 72.  And the Court has specifically held that States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against non-Indians in Indian country.  United States v. McBratney,\\n104 U.S. 621; see also Draper v. United States,\\n164 U.S. 240, 244247.  Accordingly, States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in Indian country unless preempted.  Pp.46.   (b)Under Court precedent, a States jurisdiction in Indian country may be preempted by federal law under ordinary principles of federal preemption, or when the exercise of state jurisdiction would unlawfully infringe on tribal self-government.  Neither serves to preempt state jurisdiction in this case.  Pp.620. (1)Castro-Huerta points to two federal lawsthe General Crimes Act and Public Law 280that, in his view, preempt Oklahomas authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  Neither statute, however, preempts the States jurisdiction.  Pp.718. (i)The General Crimes Act does not preempt state authority to prosecute Castro-Huertas crime.  It provides that the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed ... within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States ... shall extend to the Indian country.\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1152.  By its terms, the Act simply extend[s] the federal laws that apply on federal enclaves to Indian country.  The Act does not say that Indian country is equivalent to a federal enclave for jurisdictional purposes, that federal jurisdiction is exclusive in Indian country, or that state jurisdiction is preempted in Indian country. Castro-Huerta claims that the General Crimes Act does indeed make Indian country the jurisdictional equivalent of a federal enclave.  Castro-Huerta is wrong as a matter of text and precedent. Pointing to the history of territorial separation and Congresss reenactment of the General Crimes Act after this Court suggested in dicta in Williams v. United States,\\n327 U.S. 711, 714, that States lack jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country, Castro-Huerta argues that Congress implicitly intended for the Act to provide the Federal Government with exclusive jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  But the text of the Act says no such thing; the idea of territorial separation has long since been abandoned; and the reenactment canon cannot be invoked to override clear statutory language of the kind present in the General Crimes Act.  Castro-Huerta notes that the Court has repeated the Williams dicta on subsequent occasions, but even repeated dicta does not constitute precedent and does not alter the plain text of the General Crimes Act.  Pp.716. (ii)Castro-Huertas attempt to invoke Public Law 280,\\n\\n67Stat.\\n588, is also unpersuasive.  That law affirmatively grants certain States (and allows other States to acquire) broad jurisdiction to prosecute state-law offenses committed by or against Indians in Indian country.  \\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1162;\\n\\n25 U.S.C. 1321.  Castro-Huerta contends that the laws enactment in 1953 would have been pointless surplusage if States already had concurrent jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  But Public Law 280 contains no language preempting state jurisdiction.  And Public Law 280 encompasses far more than just non-Indian on Indian crimes.  Thus, resolution of the narrow jurisdictional issue here does not negate the significance of Public Law 280.  Pp.1618. (2)The test articulated in White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker,\\n448 U.S. 136, does not bar the State from prosecuting crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  There, the Court held that even when federal law does not preempt state jurisdiction under ordinary preemption analysis, preemption may still occur if the exercise of state jurisdiction would unlawfully infringe upon tribal self-government.  Id., at 142143.  Under Brackers balancing test, the Court considers tribal interests, federal interests, and state interests.  Id., at 145.  Here, the exercise of state jurisdiction would not infringe on tribal self-government.  And because a States jurisdiction is concurrent with federal jurisdiction, a state prosecution would not preclude an earlier or later federal prosecution.  Finally, the State has a strong sovereign interest in ensuring public safety and criminal justice within its territory, including an interest in protecting both Indian and non-Indian crime victims.  Pp.1820. (c)This Court has long held that Indian country is part of a State, not separate from it.  Under the Constitution, States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes within their territory except when preempted by federal law or by principles of tribal self-government.  The default is that States have criminal jurisdiction in Indian country unless that jurisdiction is preempted.  And that jurisdiction has not been preempted here. Pp. 2125. Reversed and remanded.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21429 _________________ OKLAHOMA, PETITIONER v. VICTOR MANUEL CASTRO-HUERTA on writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of oklahoma [June 29, 2022]  Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the Court. This case presents a jurisdictional question about the prosecution of crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country:  Under current federal law, does the Federal Government have exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute those crimes?  Or do the Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute those crimes?  We conclude that the Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. I In 2015, Victor Manuel Castro-Huerta lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with his wife and their several children, including Castro-Huertas then-5-year-old stepdaughter, who is a Cherokee Indian.  The stepdaughter has cerebral palsy and is legally blind.  One day in 2015, Castro-Huertas sister-in-law was in the house and noticed that the young girl was sick.  After a 911 call, the girl was rushed to a Tulsa hospital in critical condition.  Dehydrated, emaciated, and covered in lice and excrement, she weighed only 19 pounds.  Investigators later found her bed filled with bedbugs and cockroaches. When questioned, Castro-Huerta admitted that he had severely undernourished his stepdaughter during the preceding month.  The State of Oklahoma criminally charged both Castro-Huerta and his wife for child neglect.  Both were convicted.  Castro-Huerta was sentenced to 35 years of imprisonment, with the possibility of parole.  This case concerns the States prosecution of Castro-Huerta. After Castro-Huerta was convicted and while his appeal was pending in state court, this Court decided McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U.S. ___ (2020).  In McGirt, the Court held that Congress had never properly disestablished the Creek Nations reservation in eastern Oklahoma.  As a result, the Court concluded that the Creek Reservation remained Indian country.  Id., at ______, ___, ___ (slip op., at 13, 17, 28).  The status of that part of Oklahoma as Indian country meant that different jurisdictional rules might apply for the prosecution of criminal offenses in that area.  See 18 U.S.C. 11511153.  Based on McGirts reasoning, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals later recognized that several other Indian reservations in Oklahoma had likewise never been properly disestablished.  See, e.g., State exrel. Matloff v. Wallace, 2021 OK CR 21, 15, 497 P.3d 686, 689 (reaffirming recognition of the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Reservations); Grayson v. State, 2021 OK CR 8, 10, 485 P.3d 250, 254 (Seminole Reservation). In light of McGirt and the follow-on cases, the eastern part of Oklahoma, including Tulsa, is now recognized as Indian country.  About two million people live there, and the vast majority are not Indians. The classification of eastern Oklahoma as Indian country has raised urgent questions about which government or governments have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed there.  This case is an example:  a crime committed in what is now recognized as Indian country (Tulsa) by a non-Indian (Castro-Huerta) against an Indian (his stepdaughter).  All agree that the Federal Government has jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  The question is whether the Federal Governments jurisdiction is exclusive, or whether the State also has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Government. In the wake of McGirt, Castro-Huerta argued that the Federal Governments jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by a non-Indian against an Indian in Indian country is exclusive and that the State therefore lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him.  The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals agreed with Castro-Huerta.  Relying on an earlier Oklahoma decision holding that the federal General Crimes Act grants the Federal Government exclusive jurisdiction, the court ruled that the State did not have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  The court therefore vacated Castro-Huertas conviction.  No. F20171203 (Apr. 29, 2021); see also Bosse v. State, 2021 OK CR 3, 484 P.3d 286; Roth v. State, 2021 OK CR 27, 499 P.3d 23. While Castro-Huertas state appellate proceedings were ongoing, a federal grand jury in Oklahoma indicted Castro-Huerta for the same conduct.  Castro-Huerta accepted a plea agreement for a 7-year sentence followed by removal from the United States.  (Castro-Huerta is not a U.S. citizen and is unlawfully in the United States.)  In other words, putting aside parole possibilities, Castro-Huerta in effect received a 28-year reduction of his sentence as a result of McGirt. Castro-Huertas case exemplifies a now-familiar pattern in Oklahoma in the wake of McGirt.  The Oklahoma courts have reversed numerous state convictions on that same jurisdictional ground.  After having their state convictions reversed, some non-Indian criminals have received lighter sentences in plea deals negotiated with the Federal Government.  Others have simply gone free.  Going forward, the State estimates that it will have to transfer prosecutorial responsibility for more than 18,000 cases per year to the Federal and Tribal Governments.  All of this has created a significant challenge for the Federal Government and for the people of Oklahoma.  At the end of fiscal year 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice was opening only 22% and 31% of all felony referrals in the Eastern and Northern Districts of Oklahoma.  Dept. of Justice, U.S. Attorneys, Fiscal Year 2023 Congressional Justification 46.  And the Department recently acknowledged that many people may not be held accountable for their criminal conduct due to resource constraints.  Ibid. In light of the sudden significance of this jurisdictional question for public safety and the criminal justice system in Oklahoma, this Court granted certiorari to decide whether a State has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Government to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  595 U.S. ___ (2022).[1] II The jurisdictional dispute in this case arises because Oklahomas territory includes Indian country.  Federal law defines Indian country to include, among other things, all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government.\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1151. To begin with, the Constitution allows a State to exercise jurisdiction in Indian country.  Indian country is part of the State, not separate from the State.  To be sure, under this Courts precedents, federal law may preempt that state jurisdiction in certain circumstances.  But otherwise, as a matter of state sovereignty, a State has jurisdiction over all of its territory, including Indian country.  See U.S. Const., Amdt. 10.  As this Court has phrased it, a State is generally entitled to the sovereignty and jurisdiction over all the territory within her limits.  Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 228 (1845). In the early years of the Republic, the Federal Government sometimes treated Indian country as separate from state territoryin the same way that, for example, New Jersey is separate from New York.  Most prominently, in the 1832 decision in Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 561, this Court held that Georgia state law had no force in the Cherokee Nation because the Cherokee Nation is a distinct community occupying its own territory. But the general notion drawn from Chief Justice Marshalls opinion in Worcester v. Georgia has yielded to closer analysis.  Organized Village of Kake v. Egan,\\n\\n369 U.S. 60, 72 (1962).  By 1880 the Court no longer viewed reservations as distinct nations.  Ibid.  Since the latter half of the 1800s, the Court has consistently and explicitly held that Indian reservations are part of the surrounding State and subject to the States jurisdiction except as forbidden by federal law.  Ibid. To take a few examples:  In 1859, the Court stated:  States retain the power of a sovereign over their persons and property, so far as necessary to preserve the peace of the Commonwealth.  New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble, 21 How. 366, 370 (1859). In 1930:  [R]eservations are part of the State within which they lie and her laws, civil and criminal, have the same force therein as elsewhere within her limits, save that they can have only restricted application to the Indian wards.  Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook,\\n\\n281 U.S. 647, 651 (1930). In 1946:  [I]n the absence of a limiting treaty obligation or Congressional enactment each state ha[s] a right to exercise jurisdiction over Indian reservations within its boundaries.  New York ex rel. Ray v. Martin,\\n\\n326 U.S. 496, 499 (1946). In 1992:  This Courts more recent cases have recognized the rights of States, absent a congressional prohibition, to exercise criminal (and, implicitly, civil) jurisdiction over non-Indians located on reservation lands.  County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation,\\n\\n502 U.S. 251, 257258 (1992). And as recently as 2001:  State sovereignty does not end at a reservations border.  Nevada v. Hicks,\\n\\n533 U.S. 353, 361 (2001). In accord with that overarching jurisdictional principle dating back to the 1800s, States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in Indian country unless preempted.  In the leading case in the criminal contextthe McBratney case from 1882this Court held that States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against non-Indians in Indian country.  United States v. McBratney, \\n104 U.S. 621, 623624 (1882).  The Court stated that Colorado had criminal jurisdiction over crimes by non-Indians against non-Indians throughout the whole of the territory within its limits, including the Ute Reservation.  Id., at 624.  Several years later, the Court similarly decided that Montana had criminal jurisdiction over crimes by non-Indians against non-Indians in Indian country within that State.  Draper v. United States,\\n\\n164 U.S. 240, 244247 (1896).  The McBratney principle remains good law. In short, the Courts precedents establish that Indian country is part of a States territory and that, unless preempted, States have jurisdiction over crimes committed in Indian country. III The central question that we must decide, therefore, is whether the States authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country has been preempted.  U. S. Const., Art.VI. Under the Courts precedents, as we will explain, a States jurisdiction in Indian country may be preempted (i)by federal law under ordinary principles of federal preemption, or (ii) when the exercise of state jurisdiction would unlawfully infringe on tribal self-government. In Part IIIA, we consider whether state authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country is preempted by federal law under ordinary principles of preemption.  In Part IIIB, we consider whether principles of tribal self-government preclude the exercise of state jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. A Castro-Huerta points to two federal laws that, in his view, preempt Oklahomas authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country: (i) the General Crimes Act, which grants the Federal Government jurisdiction to prosecute crimes in Indian country,\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1152; and (ii) Public Law 280, which grants States, or authorizes States to acquire, certain additional jurisdiction over crimes committed in Indian country,\\n\\n67Stat.\\n588; see\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1162;\\n\\n25 U.S.C. 1321.  Neither statute preempts preexisting or otherwise lawfully assumed state authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. 1 As relevant here, the General Crimes Act provides:  Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, except the District of Columbia, shall extend to the Indian country.\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1152. By its terms, the Act does not preempt the States authority to prosecute non-Indians who commit crimes against Indians in Indian country.  The text of the Act simply extend[s] federal law to Indian country, leaving untouched the background principle of state jurisdiction over crimes committed within the State, including in Indian country.  Ibid. The Act also specifies the body of federal criminal law that extends to Indian countrynamely, the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.  Ibid.  Those cross-referenced general laws are the federal laws that apply in federal enclaves such as military bases and national parks.  Ibid. Importantly, however, the General Crimes Act does not say that Indian country is equivalent to a federal enclave for jurisdictional purposes.  Nor does the Act say that federal jurisdiction is exclusive in Indian country, or that state jurisdiction is preempted in Indian country. Under the General Crimes Act, therefore, both the Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in Indian country.[2]  The General Crimes Act does not preempt state authority to prosecute Castro-Huertas crime. To overcome the text, Castro-Huerta offers several counterarguments.  None is persuasive. First, Castro-Huerta advances what he describes as a textual argument.  He contends that the text of the General Crimes Act makes Indian country the jurisdictional equivalent of a federal enclave.  To begin, he points out that the Federal Government has exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in federal enclaves such as military bases and national parks.  And then Castro-Huerta asserts that the General Crimes Act in effect equates federal enclaves and Indian country.  Therefore, according to Castro-Huerta, it follows that the Federal Government also has exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in Indian country. Castro-Huertas syllogism is wrong as a textual matter.  The Act simply borrows the body of federal criminal law that applies in federal enclaves and extends it to Indian country.  The Act does not purport to equate Indian country and federal enclaves for jurisdictional purposes.  Moreover, it is not enough to speculate, as Castro-Huerta does, that Congress might have implicitly intended a jurisdictional parallel between Indian country and federal enclaves. Castro-Huertas argument also directly contradicts this Courts precedents.  As far back as 1891, the Court stated that the phrase sole and exclusive jurisdiction in the General Crimes Act is only used in the description of the laws which are extended to Indian country, not to the jurisdiction extended over the Indian country.  In re Wilson,\\n\\n140 U.S. 575, 578 (1891).  The Court repeated that analysis in 1913, concluding that the phrase sole and exclusive jurisdiction is used in order to describe the laws of the United States which by that section are extended to the Indian country.  Donnelly v. United States, \\n228 U.S. 243, 268 (1913). Stated otherwise, the General Crimes Act provides that the federal criminal laws that apply to federal enclaves also apply in Indian country.  But the extension of those federal laws to Indian country does not silently erase preexisting or otherwise lawfully assumed state jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians in Indian country. Moreover, if Castro-Huertas interpretation of the General Crimes Act were correct, then the Act would preclude States from prosecuting any crimes in Indian countrypresumably even those crimes committed by non-Indians against non-Indiansjust as States ordinarily cannot prosecute crimes committed in federal enclaves.  But this Court has long held that States may prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against non-Indians in Indian country.  See McBratney, 104 U.S., at 623624; Draper, 164 U.S., at 242246.  Those holdings, too, contravene Castro-Huertas argument regarding the General Crimes Act. In advancing his enclave argument, Castro-Huerta also tries to analogize the text of the General Crimes Act to the text of the Major Crimes Act.  He asserts that the Major Crimes Act grants the Federal Government exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute certain major crimes committed by Indians in Indian country.  But the Major Crimes Act contains substantially different language than the General Crimes Act.  Unlike the General Crimes Act, the Major Crimes Act says that defendants in Indian country shall be subject to the same law as defendants in federal enclaves.  See\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1153 (Any Indian who commits against the person or property of another Indian or other person any of certain major offenses shall be subject to the same law and penalties as all other persons committing any of the above offenses, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States).  So even assuming that the text of the Major Crimes Act provides for exclusive federal jurisdiction over major crimes committed by Indians in Indian country, see, e.g., United States v. John,\\n\\n437 U.S. 634, 651, and n. 22 (1978); Negonsott v. Samuels,\\n\\n507 U.S. 99, 103 (1993), that conclusion does not translate to the differently worded General Crimes Act. In short, the General Crimes Act does not treat Indian country as the equivalent of a federal enclave for jurisdictional purposes.  Nor does the Act make federal jurisdiction exclusive or preempt state law in Indian country. Second, Castro-Huerta contends that, regardless of the statutory text, Congress implicitly intended for the General Crimes Act to provide the Federal Government with exclusive jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. The fundamental problem with Castro-Huertas implicit intent argument is that the text of the General Crimes Act says no such thing.  Congress expresses its intentions through statutory text passed by both Houses and signed by the President (or passed over a Presidential veto).  As this Court has repeatedly stated, the text of a law controls over purported legislative intentions unmoored from any statutory text.  The Court may not replace the actual text with speculation as to Congress intent.  Magwood v. Patterson,\\n\\n561 U.S. 320, 334 (2010).  Rather, the Court will presume more modestly that the legislature says what it means and means what it says.  Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc.,\\n\\n582 U.S. 79, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see, e.g., McGirt, 591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) ([W]ishes are not laws); Virginia Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 587 U.S. ___, ___ (2019) (lead opinion) (slip op., at 14) (The Supremacy Clause cannot be deployed to elevate abstract and unenacted legislative desires above state law); Alexander v. Sandoval,\\n\\n532 U.S. 275, 287288 (2001) (The Court does not give dispositive weight to the expectations that the enacting Congress had formed in light of the contemporary legal context, because we begin (and find that we can end) our search for Congresss intent with ... text and structure (internal quotation marks omitted)); Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.,\\n\\n511 U.S. 164, 173 (1994) ([T]he text of the statute controls our decision). To buttress his implicit intent argument, Castro-Huerta seizes on the history of the General Crimes Act.  At the time of the Acts earliest iterations in 1817 and 1834, Indian country was separate from the States.  Therefore, at that time, state law did not apply in Indian countryin the same way that New York law would not ordinarily have applied in New Jersey.  But territorial separationnot jurisdictional preemption by the General Crimes Actwas the reason that state authority did not extend to Indian country at that time. Because Congress operated under a different territorial paradigm in 1817 and 1834, it had no reason at that time to consider whether to preempt preexisting or lawfully assumed state criminal authority in Indian country.  For present purposes, the fundamental point is that the text of the General Crimes Act does not preempt state law.  And this Court does not rewrite a constitutionally valid statutory text under the banner of speculation about what Congress might have done had it faced a question that ... it never faced.  Henson, 582 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  The history of territorial separation during the early years of the Republic is not a license or excuse to rewrite the text of the General Crimes Act. As noted above, the Worcester-era understanding of Indian country as separate from the State was abandoned later in the 1800s.  After that change, Indian country in each State became part of that States territory.  But Congress did not alter the General Crimes Act to make federal criminal jurisdiction exclusive in Indian country.  To this day, the text of the General Crimes Act still does not make federal jurisdiction exclusive or preempt state jurisdiction. In 1882, in McBratney, moreover, this Court held that States have jurisdiction to prosecute at least some crimes committed in Indian country.  Since 1882, therefore, Congress has been specifically aware that state criminal laws apply to some extent in Indian country.  Yet since then, Congress has never enacted new legislation that would render federal jurisdiction exclusive or preempt state jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians in Indian country.  Additionally, in 1979, the Office of Legal Counsel stated that this Court had not resolved the specific issue of state jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country, and that the issue was not settled.  3 Op. OLC 111, 117119 (1979).  Yet Congress still did not act to make federal jurisdiction exclusive or to preempt state jurisdiction. On a different tack, Castro-Huerta invokes the reenactment canon.  Castro-Huerta points out that, in 1948, Congress recodified the General Crimes Act.  Two years before that recodification, this Court suggested in dicta that States lack jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  See Williams v. United States,\\n\\n327 U.S. 711, 714 (1946).  Castro-Huerta contends that the 1948 Congress therefore intended to ratify the Williams dicta. Castro-Huertas reenactment-canon argument is misplaced.  First of all, the reenactment canon does not override clear statutory language of the kind present in the General Crimes Act.  See BP p.l.c. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 593 U.S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 11).  In addition, the canon does not apply to dicta.  See Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,\\n\\n543 U.S. 335, 349, 351, n. 12 (2005).  The Courts statements in Williams were pure dicta.  Indeed, the Williams dicta did not even purport to interpret the text of the General Crimes Act.  Dicta that does not analyze the relevant statutory provision cannot be said to have resolved the statutes meaning.  Moreover, any inference from Congresss 1948 recodification is especially weak because that recodification was not specific to the General Crimes Act, but instead was simply a general recodification of all federal criminal laws.  This Court has previously explained that the function of the 1948 recodification was generally limited to that of consolidation and codification.  Muniz v. Hoffman,\\n\\n422 U.S. 454, 474 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This Court does not infer that Congress, in revising and consolidating the laws, intended to change their policy, unless such an intention be clearly expressed.  Id., at 470 (internal quotation marks omitted). For many reasons, then, we cannot conclude that Congress, by recodifying the entire Federal Criminal Code in 1948, silently ratified a few sentences of dicta from Williams.  The reenactment canon does not apply in this case. Third, Castro-Huerta contends that the Court has repeated the 1946 Williams dicta on several subsequent occasions.  But the Courts dicta, even if repeated, does not constitute precedent and does not alter the plain text of the General Crimes Act, which was the law passed by Congress and signed by the President.  See National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Alston, 594 U.S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 21).[3] Moreover, there is a good explanation for why the Courts previous comments on this issue came only in the form of tangential dicta.  The question of whether States have concurrent jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country did not previously matter all that much and did not warrant this Courts review.  Through congressional grants of authority in Public Law 280 or state-specific statutes, some States with substantial Indian populations have long possessed broad jurisdiction to prosecute a vast array of crimes in Indian country (including crimes by Indians).  See Brief for National Congress of American Indians as Amicus Curiae 20, and n.2.  Indeed, Castro-Huerta notes that 21 States have jurisdiction over crimes by or against Indians in some Indian country.  Brief for Respondent 7.  So the General Crimes Act questionnamely, whether that Act preempts inherent state prosecutorial authority in Indian countrywas not relevant in those States. In any event, this Court never considered the General Crimes Act preemption question.  As the Office of Legal Counsel put it, many courts, without carefully considering the question, have assumed that Federal jurisdictio[n] whenever it obtains is exclusive.  We nevertheless believe that it is a matter that should not be regarded as settled before it has been fully explored by the courts.  3 Op. OLC, at 117.  This case is the first time that the matter has been fully explored by this Court. Until the Courts decision in McGirt two years ago, this question likewise did not matter much in Oklahoma.  Most everyone in Oklahoma previously understood that the State included almost no Indian country.  McGirt, 590 U.S., at ______ (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3132).  But after McGirt, about 43% of Oklahomaincluding Tulsais now considered Indian country.  Therefore, the question of whether the State of Oklahoma retains concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute non-Indian on Indian crimes in Indian country has suddenly assumed immense importance.  The jurisdictional question has now been called.  In light of the newfound significance of the question, it is necessary and appropriate for this Court to take its first hard look at the text and structure of the General Crimes Act, rather than relying on scattered dicta about a question that, until now, was relatively insignificant in the real world. After independently examining the question, we have concluded that the General Crimes Act does not preempt state jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. 2 Castro-Huerta next invokes Public Law 280 as a source of preemption.  That argument is similarly unpersuasive. Public Law 280 affirmatively grants certain States broad jurisdiction to prosecute state-law offenses committed by or against Indians in Indian country.  See\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1162.  (Other States may opt in, with tribal consent.\\n\\n25 U.S.C. 1321.)  But Public Law 280 does not preempt any preexisting or otherwise lawfully assumed jurisdiction that States possess to prosecute crimes in Indian country.  Indeed, the Court has already concluded as much:  Nothing in the language or legislative history of Pub. L. 280 indicates that it was meant to divest States of pre-existing and otherwise lawfully assumed jurisdiction.  Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P.C., 467 U.S. 138, 150 (1984).  The Courts definitive statement in Three Affiliated Tribes about Public Law 280 applies to both civil and criminal jurisdiction.  And the Courts statement follows ineluctably from the statutory text:  Public Law 280 contains no language that preempts States civil or criminal jurisdiction. Castro-Huerta separately contends that the enactment of Public Law 280 in 1953 would have been pointless surplusage if States already had concurrent jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  So he says that, as of 1953, Congress must have assumed that States did not already have concurrent jurisdiction over those crimes.  To begin with, assumptions are not laws, and the fact remains that Public Law 280 contains no language preempting state jurisdiction, as the Court already held in Three Affiliated Tribes.  Apart from that, Public Law 280 encompasses far more than just non-Indian on Indian crimes (the issue here).  Public Law 280 also grants States jurisdiction over crimes committed by Indians.  See Conference of Western Attorneys General, American Indian Law Deskbook 4.6, p. 250251 (2021 ed.); cf. Negonsott, 507 U.S., at 105107.  Absent Public Law 280, state jurisdiction over those Indian-defendant crimes could implicate principles of tribal self-government.  See White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker,\\n\\n448 U.S. 136, 142143 (1980); Part IIIB, infra.  So our resolution of the narrow jurisdictional issue in this case does not negate the significance of Public Law 280 in affording States broad criminal jurisdiction over other crimes committed in Indian country, such as crimes committed by Indians.[4] In any event, to the extent that there is any overlap (or even complete overlap) between Public Law 280s jurisdictional grant and some of the States preexisting jurisdiction with respect to crimes committed in Indian country, it made good sense for Congress in 1953 to explicitly grant such authority in Public Law 280.  The scope of the States authority had not previously been resolved by this Court, except in cases such as McBratney and Draper with respect to non-Indian on non-Indian crimes.  Congressional action in the face of such legal uncertainty cannot reasonably be characterized as unnecessary surplusage.  See Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. ___, ______ (2019) (slip op., at 2021).  And finally, even if there is some surplusage, the Court has stated that [r]edundancy is not a silver bullet when interpreting statutes.  Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc., 586 U.S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 11). In sum, Public Law 280 does not preempt state authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. B Applying what has been referred to as the Bracker balancing test, this Court has recognized that even when federal law does not preempt state jurisdiction under ordinary preemption analysis, preemption may still occur if the exercise of state jurisdiction would unlawfully infringe upon tribal self-government.  See Bracker, 448 U.S., at 142143; see also New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe,\\n\\n462 U.S. 324, 333335 (1983).  Under the Bracker balancing test, the Court considers tribal interests, federal interests, and state interests.  448 U.S., at 145.[5] Here, Bracker does not bar the State from prosecuting crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. First, the exercise of state jurisdiction here would not infringe on tribal self-government.  In particular, a state prosecution of a crime committed by a non-Indian against an Indian would not deprive the tribe of any of its prosecutorial authority.  That is because, with exceptions not invoked here, Indian tribes lack criminal jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians such as Castro-Huerta, even when non-Indians commit crimes against Indians in Indian country.  See Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe,\\n\\n435 U.S. 191, 195 (1978). Moreover, a state prosecution of a non-Indian does not involve the exercise of state power over any Indian or over any tribe.  The only parties to the criminal case are the State and the non-Indian defendant.  Therefore, as has been recognized, any tribal self-government justification for preemption of state jurisdiction would be problematic.  American Indian Law Deskbook 4.8, at 260; see Three Affiliated Tribes, 467 U.S., at 148; see also Hicks, 533 U.S., at 364; McBratney, 104 U.S., at 623624; Draper, 164 U.S., at 242243.[6] Second, a state prosecution of a non-Indian likewise would not harm the federal interest in protecting Indian victims.  State prosecution would supplement federal authority, not supplant federal authority.  As the United States has explained in the past, recognition of concurrent state jurisdiction could facilitate effective law enforcement on the Reservation, and thereby further the federal and tribal interests in protecting Indians and their property against the actions of non-Indians.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Arizona v. Flint, O. T. 1988, No. 603, p.6.  The situation might be different if state jurisdiction ousted federal jurisdiction.  But because the States jurisdiction would be concurrent with federal jurisdiction, a state prosecution would not preclude an earlier or later federal prosecution and would not harm the federal interest in protecting Indian victims. Third, the State has a strong sovereign interest in ensuring public safety and criminal justice within its territory, and in protecting all crime victims.  See Dibble, 21 How., at 370.  The State also has a strong interest in ensuring that criminal offendersespecially violent offendersare appropriately punished and do not harm others in the State. The States interest in protecting crime victims includes both Indian and non-Indian victims.  If his victim were a non-Indian, Castro-Huerta could be prosecuted by the State, as he acknowledges.  But because his victim is an Indian, Castro-Huerta says that he is free from state prosecution.  Castro-Huertas argument would require this Court to treat Indian victims as second-class citizens.  We decline to do so.[7] IV The dissent emphasizes the history of mistreatment of American Indians.  But that history does not resolve the legal questions presented in this case.  Those questions are:  (i)whether Indian country is part of a State or instead is separate and independent from a State; and (ii)if Indian country is part of a State, whether the State has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Government to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. The answers to those questions are straightforward.  On the first question, as explained above, this Court has repeatedly ruled that Indian country is part of a State, not separate from a State.  By contrast, the dissent lifts up the 1832 decision in Worcester v. Georgia as a proper exposition of Indian law.  But this Court long ago made clear that Worcester rested on a mistaken understanding of the relationship between Indian country and the States.  The Court has stated that the general notion drawn from Chief Justice Marshalls opinion in Worcester v. Georgia has yielded to closer analysis:  By 1880 the Court no longer viewed reservations as distinct nations.  On the contrary, it was said that a reservation was in many cases a part of the surrounding State or Territory, and subject to its jurisdiction except as forbidden by federal law.  Organized Village of Kake, 369 U.S., at 72. Because Indian country is part of a State, not separate from a State, the second question herethe question regarding the States jurisdiction to prosecute Castro-Huertais also straightforward.  Under the Constitution, States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes within their territory except when preempted (in a manner consistent with the Constitution) by federal law or by principles of tribal self-government.  As we have explained, no federal law preempts the States exercise of jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  And principles of tribal self-government likewise do not preempt state jurisdiction here. As a corollary to its argument that Indian country is inherently separate from States, the dissent contends that Congress must affirmatively authorize States to exercise jurisdiction in Indian country, even jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians.  But under the Constitution and this Courts precedents, the default is that States may exercise criminal jurisdiction within their territory.  See Amdt. 10.  States do not need a permission slip from Congress to exercise their sovereign authority.  In other words, the default is that States have criminal jurisdiction in Indian country unless that jurisdiction is preempted.  In the dissents view, by contrast, the default is that States do not have criminal jurisdiction in Indian country unless Congress specifically provides it.  The dissents view is inconsistent with the Constitutions structure, the States inherent sovereignty, and the Courts precedents. Straying further afield, the dissent seizes on treaties from the 1800s.  Post, at 1820, and n.4 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).[8]  But those treaties do not preclude state jurisdiction here.  The dissent relies heavily on the 1835 Treaty of New Echota, which stated that Indian country was separate from States, and which the dissent says was preserved in relevant part by the 1866 Treaty.  See Treaty with the Cherokee (New Echota), Art. 5, Dec. 29, 1835,\\n\\n7Stat.\\n481; Treaty with the Cherokee, July 19, 1866,\\n\\n14Stat.\\n709.  But history and legal development did not end in 1866.  Some early treaties may have been consistent with the Worcester-era theory of separateness.  But as relevant here, those treaties have been supplanted:  Specific to Oklahoma, those treaties, in relevant part, were formally supplanted no later than the 1906 Act enabling Oklahomas statehood.  See Oklahoma Enabling Act, ch.3335,\\n\\n34Stat.\\n267.  As this Court has previously concluded, admission of a State into the Union necessarily repeals the provisions of any prior statute, or of any existing treaty that is inconsistent with the States exercise of criminal jurisdiction throughout the whole of the territory within its limits, including Indian country, unless the enabling act says otherwise by express words.  McBratney, 104 U.S., at 623624; see Draper, 164 U.S., at 242246.  The Oklahoma Enabling Act contains no such express exception.  Therefore, at least since Oklahomas statehood in the early 1900s, Indian country has been part of the territory of Oklahoma. The dissent responds that the language of the 1906 statute enabling Oklahomas statehood itself established a jurisdictional division between the State and Indian country.  See post, at 2022 (discussing the Oklahoma Enabling Act).  That argument is mistaken.  This Court long ago explained that interpreting a statehood act to divest a State of jurisdiction over Indian country wholly situated within [its] geographical boundaries would undermine the very nature of the equality conferred on the State by virtue of its admission into the Union.  Draper, 164 U.S., at 242243.  So the Court requires clear statutory language to create an exception to that rule.  Id., at 244.  To reiterate, the Oklahoma Enabling Act contains no such clear language.  Indeed, the Court has interpreted similar statutory language in other state enabling acts not to displace state jurisdiction.  See id., at 243247; Organized Village of Kake, 369 U.S., at 6771.  In Organized Village of Kake, the Court specifically addressed several state enabling acts, including the Oklahoma Enabling Act, and stated that statutory language reserving jurisdiction and control to the United States was meant to preserve federal jurisdiction to the extent that it existed before statehood, not to make federal jurisdiction exclusive.  Id., at 6770.  Consistent with that precedent, todays decision recognizes that the Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.[9] The dissent incorrectly seeks to characterize various aspects of the Courts decision as dicta.  To be clear, the Court today holds that Indian country within a States territory is part of a State, not separate from a State.  Therefore, a State has jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in Indian country unless state jurisdiction is preempted.  With respect to crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country, the Court today further holds that the General Crimes Act does not preempt the States authority to prosecute; that Public Law 280 does not preempt the States authority to prosecute; that no principle of tribal self-government preempts the States authority to prosecute; that the cited treaties do not preempt Oklahomas authority to prosecute; and that the Oklahoma Enabling Act does not preempt Oklahomas authority to prosecute (indeed, it solidifies the States presumptive sovereign authority to prosecute).  Comments in the dissenting opinion suggesting anything otherwise are just that: comments in a dissenting opinion.  Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz,\\n\\n449 U.S. 166, 177, n. 10 (1980). From start to finish, the dissent employs extraordinary rhetoric in articulating its deeply held policy views about what Indian law should be.  The dissent goes so far as to draft a proposed statute for Congress.  But this Courts proper role under Article III of the Constitution is to declare what the law is, not what we think the law should be.  The dissents views about the jurisdictional question presented in this case are contrary to this Courts precedents and to the laws enacted by Congress. *** We conclude that the Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered. &&& SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21429 _________________ OKLAHOMA, PETITIONER v. VICTOR MANUEL CASTRO-HUERTA on writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of oklahoma [June 29, 2022]  Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting. In 1831, Georgia arrested Samuel Worcester, a white missionary, for preaching to the Cherokee on tribal lands without a license.  Really, the prosecution was a show of forcean attempt by the State to demonstrate its authority over tribal lands.  Speaking for this Court, Chief Justice Marshall refused to endorse Georgias ploy because the State enjoyed no lawful right to govern the territory of a separate sovereign.  See Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 561 (1832).  The Courts decision was deeply unpopular, and both Georgia and President Jackson flouted it.  But in time, Worcester came to be recognized as one of this Courts finer hours.  The decision established a foundational rule that would persist for over 200 years:  Native American Tribes retain their sovereignty unless and until Congress ordains otherwise.  Worcester proved that, even in the [c]ourts of the conqueror, the rule of law meant something.  Johnsons Lessee v. McIntosh, 8 Wheat. 543, 588 (1823). Where this Court once stood firm, today it wilts.  After the Cherokees exile to what became Oklahoma, the federal government promised the Tribe that it would remain forever free from interference by state authorities.  Only the Tribe or the federal government could punish crimes by or against tribal members on tribal lands.  At various points in its history, Oklahoma has chafed at this limitation.  Now, the State seeks to claim for itself the power to try crimes by non-Indians against tribal members within the Cherokee Reservation.  Where our predecessors refused to participate in one States unlawful power grab at the expense of the Cherokee, todays Court accedes to anothers.  Respectfully, I dissent. I A Long before our Republic, the Cherokee controlled much of what is now Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.  See 1 G. Litton, History of Oklahoma at the Golden Anniversary of Statehood 91 (1957) (Litton).  The Cherokee were a distinct, independent political communit[y], who retain[ed] their original sovereign right to regulat[e] their internal and social relations.  Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez,\\n\\n436 U.S. 49, 55 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted). As colonists settled coastal areas near Cherokee territory, the Tribe proved a valuable trading partnerand a military threat.  See W. Echo-Hawk, In the Court of the Conqueror 89 (2010).  Recognizing this, Great Britain signed a treaty with the Cherokee in 1730.  See 1 Litton 92.  As was true of tributary and feudatory states in Europe, the Cherokee did not cease to be sovereign and independent under this arrangement, but retained the right to govern their internal affairs.  E.de Vattel, Law of Nations 6061 (1805); see Worcester, 6 Pet., at 561.  Meanwhile, under British law the crown possessed centraliz[ed] authority over diplomacy with Tribes to the exclusion of colonial governments.  See C.Berkey, United StatesIndian Relations: The Constitutional Basis, in Exiled in the Land of the Free 192 (H. Lyons ed. 1992). Ultimately, the American Revolution replaced that legal framework with a similar one.  When the delegates drafted the Articles of Confederation, they debated whether the national or state authorities should manage Indian affairs.  See 6 Journals of the Continental Congress, 17741789, pp. 10771079 (W. Ford ed. 1906).  The resulting compromise proved unworkable.  The Articles granted Congress the sole and exclusive right and power of ... regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians.  Art. IX.  But the Articles undermined that assignment by further providing that the legislative right of any state[,] within its own limits, could not be infringed or violated.  Ibid.  Together, these provisions led to battles between national and state governments over who could oversee relations with various Tribes.  See G. Ablavsky, Beyond the Indian Commerce Clause, 124 Yale L.J. 1012, 10331035 (2015) (Ablavsky).  James Madison later complained that the Articles division of authority over Indian affairs had endeavored to accomplish [an] impossibilit[y]; to reconcile a partial sovereignty in the Union, with complete sovereignty in the States.  The Federalist No. 42, p. 269 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). When the framers convened to draft a new Constitution, this problem was among those they sought to resolve.  To that end, they gave the federal government broad general powers over Indian affairs.  United States v. Lara,\\n\\n541 U.S. 193, 200 (2004).  The Constitution afforded Congress authority to make war and negotiate treaties with the Tribes.  See Art. I,  8; Art. VI, cl.2.  It barred States from doing either of these things.  See Art. I, 10.  And the Constitution granted Congress the power to regulate Commerce ... with the Indian Tribes.  Art. I, 8, cl. 3.  Nor did the Constitution replicate the Articles carveout for state power over Tribes within their borders.  Madison praised this change, contending that the new federal government would be very properly unfettered from this prior limitatio[n].  The Federalist No. 42, at 268.  Antifederalist Abraham Yates agreed (but bemoaned) that the Constitution totally surrender[ed] into the hands of Congress the management and regulation of the Indian affairs.  Letter to the Citizens of the State of New York (June 1314, 1788), in 20 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution 1153, 1158 (J. Kaminski et al. eds. 2004). Consistent with that view, the Washington Administration insisted that the federal government enjoyed exclusive constitutional authority over tribal relations.  Ablavsky 1019.  The new Administration understood, too, that Tribes remained otherwise free to govern their internal affairs without state interference.  See id., at 10411042, 10651067.  In a letter to the Governor of Pennsylvania, President Washington stated curtly that the United States ... posses[es] the only authority of regulating an intercourse with [the Indians], and redressing their grievances.  Letter to T. Mifflin (Sept. 4, 1790), in 6 Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 396 (D. Twohig ed. 1996).  Even Thomas Jefferson, the great defender of the States powers, agreed that under the present Constitution no State [has] a right to Treat with the Indians without the consent of the General Government.  Letter to H. Knox (Aug. 10, 1791), in 22 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 27 (C. Cullen, E. Sheridan, & R Lester eds. 1986). Nor was this view confined to the Executive Branch.  Congress quickly exercised its new constitutional authority.  In 1790, it enacted the first Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, which pervasively regulated commercial and social exchanges among Indians and non-Indians.  Ch. 33,\\n\\n1Stat.\\n137.  Congress also provided for federal jurisdiction over crimes by non-Indians against Indians on tribal lands.  56, id., at 138.  States, too, recognized their lack of authority.  See Ablavsky 1019, 1043.  In 1789, South Carolina Governor Charles Pinckney acknowledged to Washington that the sole management of India[n] affairs is now committed to the general Government.  Letter to G. Washington (Dec. 14), in 4 Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 401, 404 (D. Twohig ed. 1993).  Initially, even Georgia took the same view.  See Letter from Georgia House of Representatives to Governor Edward Telfair (June 10, 1790), in 3 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution: Delaware, New Jersey, Georgia, and Connecticut 178 (M. Jensen ed. 1978) (Microform Supp. Doc. No. 50). It was against this background that Chief Justice Marshall faced Worcester.  After gold was discovered in Cherokee territory in the 1820s, Georgias Legislature enacted laws designed to seize [the] whole Cherokee country, parcel it out among the neighboring counties of the state ... abolish [the Tribes] institutions and its laws, and annihilate its political existence.  Worcester, 6 Pet., at 542.  Like Oklahoma today, Georgia also purported to extend its criminal laws to Cherokee lands.  See ibid.; see also S. Breyer, The Cherokee Indians and the Supreme Court, 87 The Georgia Historical Q. 408, 416418 (2003) (Breyer).  In refusing to sanction Georgias power grab, this Court explained that the States assertion of jurisdiction over the Cherokee nation was void, because under our Constitution only the federal government possessed the power to manage relations with the Tribe.  Worcester, 6 Pet., at 542, 561562. B  Two years later, and exercising its authority to regulate tribal affairs in the shadow of Worcester, Congress adopted the General Crimes Act of 1834 (GCA).  That law extended federal criminal jurisdiction to tribal lands for certain crimes and, in doing so, served two apparent purposes.  First, as a courtesy to the Tribes, the law represented a promise by the federal government to punish crimes ... committed ... by and against our own [non-Indian] citizens. H.Rep. No. 474, 23d Cong., 1st Sess., 13 (1834) (H. Rep. No. 474).  That jurisdictional arrangement was also consistent with, and even seemingly compelled by, the federal governments treaties with various Tribes.  See F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 731 (N. Newton etal. eds. 2005) (Cohen); R. Clinton, Development of Criminal Jurisdiction Over Indian Lands: The Historical Perspective, 17 Ariz. L.Rev. 951, 958962 (1975) (Clinton).  Second, because Worcester held that States lacked criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands, Congress sought to ensure a federal forum for crimes committed by and against non-Indians.  See H. Rep. No. 474, at 13.  Otherwise, Congress understood, non-Indian settlers would be subject to tribal jurisdiction alone.  See id., at 13, 18; R.Barsh & J. Henderson, The Betrayal, Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe and the Hunting of the Snark, 63 Minn. L. Rev. 609, 625626 (1979).  Congress reenacted the GCA in 1948 with minor amendments, but it remains in force today more or less in its original form.  See 18 U.S.C. 1152 (1946 ed., Supp. II). Shortly after it adopted the GCA, the Senate ratified the Treaty of New Echota with the Cherokee in 1836.  After the Tribes removal from Georgia, the United States promised the Cherokee that they would enjoy a new home in the West where they could establish ... a government of their choice.  Treaty with the Cherokee, Preamble, Dec. 29, 1835,\\n\\n7Stat.\\n478.  Acknowledging the Tribes past difficulties ... under the jurisdiction and laws of the State Governments, the treaty also pledged that the Tribe would remain forever free from State sovereignties.  Ibid.; see Art. 5, id., at 481.  These promises constituted an indemnity, guaranteed by the faith of the nation, that [t]he United States and the Indian tribes [would be] the sole parties with power on new western reservations like the Cherokees.  H.Rep. No. 474, at 18 (emphasis in original). Over time, Congress revised some of these arrangements.  In 1885, dissatisfied with how the Sioux Tribe responded to the murder of a tribal member, Congress adopted the Major Crimes Act (MCA).  See R. Anderson, S. Krakoff, & B. Berger, American Indian Law: Cases and Commentary 9096 (4th ed. 2008) (Anderson).  There, Congress directed that, moving forward, only the federal government, not the Tribes, could prosecute certain serious offenses by tribal members on tribal lands.  See 18 U.S.C. 1153(a).  On its own initiative, this Court then went a step further.  Relying on language in certain laws admitting specific States to the Union, the Court held that States were now entitled to prosecute crimes by non-Indians against non-Indians on tribal lands.  See United States v. McBratney,\\n\\n104 U.S. 621, 623 (1882); Draper v. United States,\\n\\n164 U.S. 240, 243, 247 (1896).  Through all these developments, however, at least one promise remained:  States could play no role in the prosecution of crimes by or against Native Americans on tribal lands.  See Williams v. Lee,\\n\\n358 U.S. 217, 220 (1959). In 1906, Congress reaffirmed this promise to the Cherokee in Oklahoma.  As a condition of its admission to the Union, Congress required Oklahoma to declare that [it] forever disclaim[s] all right and title in or to ... all lands lying within [the States] limits owned or held by any Indian, tribe, or nation.\\n\\n34Stat.\\n270.  Instead, Congress provided that tribal lands would remain subject to the jurisdiction, disposal, and control of the United States.  Ibid.  As if the point wasnt clear enough, Congress further provided that nothing contained in the [new Oklahoma state] constitution shall be construed to ... limit or affect the authority of the Government of the United States ... respecting [the States] Indians ... which it would have been competent to make if this Act had never been passed.  Id., at 267268.  The following year, Oklahoma adopted a State Constitution consistent with Congresss instructions.  Art. I,  3; see also Clinton 961. In the years that followed, certain States sought arrangements different from Oklahomas.  And once more, Congress intervened.  In 1940, Kansas asked for and received permission from Congress to exercise jurisdiction over crimes by or against Indians on tribal lands.  18 U.S.C. 3243.  Through the rest of the decade, Congress experimented with similar laws for New York, Iowa, and North Dakota.[1]  Then, in 1953, Congress adopted Public Law 280.  That statute granted five additional States criminal jurisdiction over offenses ... by or against Indians and established procedures by which further States could secure the same authority.  See ch. 505,  2,\\n\\n67Stat.\\n588.  Ultimately, however, some of these arrangements proved unpopular.  Not only with affected Tribes.  See C. Goldberg-Ambrose, Public Law 280 and the Problem of Lawlessness in California Indian Country, 44 UCLA L. Rev. 1405, 14061407 (1997) (Goldberg-Ambrose).  These arrangements also proved unpopular with certain States that viewed their new law enforcement responsibilities on tribal lands as unfunded federal mandates.  See Anderson 436.  A few States even renounced their Public Law 280 jurisdiction.  See Cohen 579. By 1968, the federal government came to conclude that, as a matter of justice and as a matter of enlightened social policy, the time ha[d] come to break decisively with the past and to create the conditions for a new era in which the Indian future is determined by Indian acts and Indian decisions.  Richard M. Nixon, Special Message on Indian Affairs (July 8, 1970).  Consistent with that vision, Congress amended Public Law 280 to require tribal consent before any State could assume jurisdiction over crimes by or against Indians on tribal lands.  Act of Apr. 11, 1968,  401,\\n\\n82Stat.\\n78, 406, id., at 80 (25 U.S.C.  1321(a), 1326).  Recognizing that certain States enabling acts barred state authority on tribal lands and required States to adopt constitutional provisions guaranteeing as much, Congress also authorized States to amend, where necessary, their State constitution or ... statutes.  404,\\n\\n82Stat.\\n79 (25 U.S.C. 1324).  In doing so, however, Congress emphasized that affected States could not assume jurisdiction to prosecute offenses by or against tribal members on tribal lands until they appropriately amended their State constitution or statutes.  Ibid.  To date, Oklahoma has not amended its state constitutional provisions disclaiming jurisdiction over tribal lands.  Nor has Oklahoma sought or obtained tribal consent to the exercise of its jurisdiction.  See The Honorable E. Kelly Haney, 22 Okla. Op. Atty. Gen. No.  9032, 72, 1991 WL 567868, *1 (Mar. 1, 1991) (Haney).  Thus, Oklahoma has remained, in Congresss words, a State not having jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed by or against Indians in the areas of Indian country situated within its borders.  25 U.S.C. 1321(a). C Rather than seek tribal consent pursuant to Public Law 280 or persuade Congress to adopt a state-specific statute authorizing it to prosecute crimes by or against tribal members on tribal lands, Oklahoma has chosen a different path.  In the decades following statehood, many settlers engaged in schemes to seize Indian lands and mineral rights by subterfuge.  See A.Debo, And Still the Waters Run 92125 (1940) (Debo).  These schemes resulted in the bulk of the landed wealth of the Indians ending up in the hands of the new settlers.  See ibid.; see also id., at 181202.  State officials and courts were sometimes complicit in the process.  See id., at 182183, 185, 195196.  For years, too, Oklahoma courts asserted the power to hear criminal cases involving Native Americans on lands allotted to and owned by tribal members despite the contrary commands of the Oklahoma Enabling Act and the States own constitution.  The State only disavowed that practice in 1991, after defeats in state and federal court.  See Haney, 1991 WL 567868, *1*3; see also State v. Klindt, 782 P.2d 401, 404 (Okla. Crim. App. 1989); Ross v. Neff, 905 F.2d 1349, 1353 (CA10 1990). Still, it seems old habits die slowly.  Even after renouncing the power to try criminal cases involving Native Americans on allotted tribal lands, Oklahoma continued to claim the power to prosecute crimes by or against Native Americans within tribal reservations.  The State did so on the theory that at some (unspecified) point in the past, Congress had disestablished those reservations.  In McGirt v. Oklahoma, this Court rejected that argument in a case involving the Muscogee (Creek) Tribe.  591 U.S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 1).  We explained that Congress had never disestablished the Creek Reservation.  Nor were we willing to usurp Congresss authority and disestablish that reservation by a lawless act of judicial fiat.  See id., at ___ (slip op., at 42).  Accordingly, only federal and tribal authorities were lawfully entitled to try crimes by or against Native Americans within the Tribes reservation.  Ibid.  Following McGirt, Oklahomas courts recognized that what held true for the Creek also held true for the Cherokee:  Congress had never disestablished its reservation and, accordingly, the State lacked authority to try offenses by or against tribal members within the Cherokee Reservation.  See Spears v. State, 2021 OK CR 7,  1014, 485 P.3d 873, 876877. Once more, Oklahoma could have responded to this development by asking Congress for state-specific legislation authorizing it to exercise criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands, as Kansas and various other States have done.  The State could have employed the procedures of Public Law 280 to amend its own laws and obtain tribal consent.  Instead, Oklahoma responded with a media and litigation campaign seeking to portray reservations within its Statewhere federal and tribal authorities may prosecute crimes by and against tribal members and Oklahoma can pursue cases involving only non-Indiansas lawless dystopias.  See Brief for Cherokee Nation etal. as Amici Curiae 18 (Cherokee Brief) (The States tale of a criminal dystopia in eastern Oklahoma is just that: A tale). That effort culminated in this case.  In it, Oklahoma has pursued alternative lines of argument.  First, the State has asked this Court to revisit McGirt and unilaterally eliminate all reservations in Oklahoma.  Second, the State has argued that it enjoys a previously unrecognized inherent authority to try crimes within reservation boundaries by non-Indians against tribal membersa claim Oklahomas own courts have rejected.  See Bosse v. State, 2021 OK CR 3, 484 P.3d 286, 294295. Ultimately, this Court declined to entertain the States first argument but agreed to review the second.  Nominally, the question comes to us in a case involving Victor Castro-Huerta, a non-Indian who abused his Cherokee stepdaughter within the Tribes reservation.  Initially, a state court convicted him for a state crime.  After McGirt, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals determined that his conviction was invalid because only federal and tribal officials possess authority to prosecute crimes by or against Native Americans on the Cherokee Reservation.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a.  The federal government swiftly reindicted Mr. Castro-Huerta, and a federal court again found him guilty.  Now before us, Oklahoma seeks to undo Mr. Castro-Huertas federal conviction and have him transferred from federal prison to a state facility to resume his state sentence. Really, though, this case has less to do with where Mr. Castro-Huerta serves his time and much more to do with Oklahomas effort to gain a legal foothold for its wish to exercise jurisdiction over crimes involving tribal members on tribal lands.  To succeed, Oklahoma must disavow adverse rulings from its own courts; disregard its 1991 recognition that it lacks legal authority to try cases of this sort; and ignore fundamental principles of tribal sovereignty, a treaty, the Oklahoma Enabling Act, its own state constitution, and Public Law 280.  Oklahoma must pursue a proposition so novel and so unlikely that in over two centuries not a single State has successfully attempted it in this Court.  Incredibly, too, the defense of tribal interests against the States gambit falls to a non-Indian criminal defendant.  The real party in interest here isnt Mr. Castro-Huerta but the Cherokee, a Tribe of 400,000 members with its own government.  Yet the Cherokee have no voice as parties in these proceedings; they and other Tribes are relegated to the filing of amicus briefs. II A Today the Court rules for Oklahoma. In doing so, the Court announces that, when it comes to crimes by non-Indians against tribal members within tribal reservations, Oklahoma may exercise jurisdiction.  Ante, at 4.  But this declaration comes as if by oracle, without any sense of the history recounted above and unattached to any colorable legal authority.  Truly, a more ahistorical and mistaken statement of Indian law would be hard to fathom. The source of the Courts error is foundational.  Through most of its opinion, the Court proceeds on the premise that Oklahoma possesses inherent sovereign power to prosecute crimes on tribal reservations until and unless Congress preempt[s] that authority.  Ante, at 518.  The Court emphasizes that States normally wield broad police powers within their borders absent some preemptive federal law.  See ante, at 46; see also Virginia Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 587 U.S. ___, ___ (2019) (lead opinion) (slip op., at 12). But the effort to wedge Tribes into that paradigm is a category error.  Tribes are not private organizations within state boundaries.  Their reservations are not glorified private campgrounds.  Tribes are sovereigns.  And the preemption rule applicable to them is exactly the opposite of the normal rule.  Tribal sovereignty means that the criminal laws of the States can have no force on tribal members within tribal bounds unless and until Congress clearly ordains otherwise.  Worcester, 6 Pet., at 561.  After all, the power to punish crimes by or against ones own citizens within ones own territory to the exclusion of other authorities is and has always been among the most essential attributes of sovereignty.  See, e.g., Wilson v. Girard,\\n\\n354 U.S. 524, 529 (1957) (percuriam) (A sovereign nation has exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders); see also Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, 136 (1812); E. de Vattel, Law of Nations 8182 (1835 ed.). Nor is this notion, ante, at 5, some discarded artifact of a bygone era.  To be sure, Washington, Jefferson, Marshall, and so many others at the Nations founding appreciated the sovereign status of Native American Tribes.  See Part IA, supra.  But this Courts own cases have consistently reaffirmed the point.  Just weeks ago, the Court held that federal prosecutors did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause based on the essential premise that tribal criminal law is the product of a separate sovereig[n] exercising its own retained sovereignty.  Denezpi v. United States, 596 U.S. ___, ___ (2022) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Recently, too, this Court confirmed that Tribes enjoy sovereign immunity from suit.  See Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community,\\n\\n572 U.S. 782, 788789 (2014).   Throughout our history, the basic policy of Worcester that Tribes are separate sovereigns has remained.  Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S., at 219.[2] Because Tribes are sovereigns, this Court has consistently recognized that the usual standards of pre-emption are unhelpful.  White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker,\\n\\n448 U.S. 136, 143 (1980); see also Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico,\\n\\n490 U.S. 163, 176 (1989); Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation,\\n\\n425 U.S. 463, 475476 (1976); McClanahan v. Arizona Tax Commn,\\n\\n411 U.S. 164, 170172 (1973).  In typical preemption cases, courts start with the assumption that Congress has not displaced state authority.  Rice v. SantaFe Elevator Corp.,\\n\\n331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947).  But when a State tries to regulate tribal affairs, the same backdrop does not apply because Tribes have a claim to sovereignty [that] long predates that of our own Government.  McClanahan, 411 U.S., at 172; see also Bracker, 448 U.S., at 143.  So instead of searching for an Act of Congress displacing state authority, our cases require a search for federal legislation conferring state authority:  [U]nless and until Congress acts, the tribes retain their historic sovereign authority.  Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S., at 788 (internal quotation marks omitted); see United States v. Cooley, 593 U.S. ___, ______ (2021) (slip op., at 34) (instructing courts to ask if a treaty or statute has explicitly divested Indian tribes of the ... authority at issue); Anderson 317.  What is more, courts must tread lightly before concluding Congress has abrogated tribal sovereignty in favor of state authority.  Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S., at 60.  Any ambiguities in   Congresss work must be resolved in favor of tribal sovereignty and against state power.  See ibid.; see also Cotton Petroleum, 490 U.S., at 177.  And, if anything, these rules bear special force in the criminal context, which lies at the heart of tribal sovereignty and in which Congress has provided a nearly comprehensive set of statutes allocating criminal jurisdiction among federal, tribal, and state authorities.  Cohen 527.[3] B From 1834 to 1968, Congress adopted a series of laws governing criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands.  Those laws are many, detailed, and clear.  Each operates against the backdrop understanding that Tribes are sovereign and that in our constitutional order only Congress may displace their authority.  Nor does anything in Congresss work begin to confer on Oklahoma the authority it seeks. 1 Start with the GCA, first adopted by Congress in 1834 and most recently reenacted in 1948.  The GCA provides: Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, except the District of Columbia, shall extend to Indian Country.  This section shall not extend to offenses committed by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian, nor to any Indian committing any offense in the Indian country who has been punished by the local law of the tribe, or to any case where, by treaty stipulations, the exclusive jurisdiction over such offenses is or may be secured to the Indian tribes respectively. 18 U.S.C. 1152. As recounted above, Congress adopted the GCA in the aftermath of Worcesters holding that the federal government alone may regulate tribal affairs and States do not possess inherent authority to apply their criminal laws on tribal lands.  Responding to that decision, Congress did not choose to exercise its authority to allow state jurisdiction on tribal lands.  Far from it.  Congress chose only to extend federal law to tribal landsand even then only for certain crimes involving non-Indian settlers.  Otherwise, Congress recognized, those settlers might be subject to tribal criminal jurisdiction alone.  See Part IB, supra.  Several features of the law confirm this understanding.  Take just three. First, the GCA compares Indian country to place[s] within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.   1152.  The latter category refers to federal enclaves like national parks and military bases that the Constitution places under exclusive federal control.  See Art. I, 8, cl. 17; United States v. Cowboy, 694 F.2d 1228, 1234 (CA10 1982); see also Exparte Crow Dog,\\n\\n109 U.S. 556, 567 (1883).  And state laws generally do not apply in federal enclaves.  See, e.g., Fort Leavenworth R.Co. v. Lowe,\\n\\n114 U.S. 525, 532533 (1885).  Rather than unambiguously endow States with any sort of prosecutorial authority on tribal lands, the GCA thus makes plain that tribal lands are to be treated like federal enclaves subject to federal, not state, control. Second, the GCA provides that the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses shall apply on tribal lands.   1152.  Again, nothing here purports to extend state criminal laws to tribal lands.  Quite the contrary.  It would hardly make sense to apply federal general criminal lawto address all crimes ranging from murder to jaywalkingif state general criminal law already did the job.  Traditionally, this Court does not assume multiple sets of [general] criminal laws apply to those subject to federal protection.  Lewis v. United States,\\n\\n523 U.S. 155, 163 (1998).  Instead, when Congress converts an area into a federal enclave, we usually presume later-enacted state law does not apply.  Parker Drilling Management Services, Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at9). Third, after applying the federal governments general criminal laws to tribal lands, the GCA carves out some exceptions.  It provides that federal law shall not extend to crimes involving only Indians, crimes by Indians where the perpetrator has been punished by the local law of the tribe, or where a treaty grants a Tribe exclusive jurisdiction.   1152.  These exceptions ensure that the federal government does not meddle in cases most likely to implicate tribal sovereignty.  And it defies the imagination to think Congress would have taken such care to limit federal authority over these most sensitive cases while (somewhere, somehow) leaving States, so often the Tribes deadliest enemies, to enjoy free rein.  United States v. Kagama,\\n\\n118 U.S. 375, 384 (1886). 2 When Congress enacted the MCA in 1885, it proceeded once more against the backdrop rule that only tribal criminal law applies on tribal lands, that States enjoy no inherent authority to prosecute cases on tribal lands, and that only Congress may displace tribal power.  Nor, once more, did Congresss new legislation purport to allow States to prosecute crimes on tribal lands.  In response to concerns with how tribal authorities were handling major crimes committed by tribal members, in the MCA Congress took a step beyond the GCA and instructed that, in the future, the federal government would have exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute certain crimes by Indian defendants on tribal lands.  18 U.S.C. 1153(a); see also Part IB, supra.  Here again, Congresss work hardly would have been necessary or made sense if States already possessed jurisdiction to try crimes by or against Indians on tribal reservations.  Plainly, Congresss purpose in adopting the MCA was to answer the objection that major crimes by tribal members on tribal lands would otherwise be subject to prosecution by tribal authorities alone.  See Kagama, 118 U.S., at 383385. 3 Consider next the Treaty of New Echota and the Oklahoma Enabling Act.  In 1835, the United States entered into a treaty with the Cherokee.  In that treaty, the Nation promised that, within a new reservation in what was to become Oklahoma, the Tribe would enjoy the right to govern itself and remain forever free from State sovereignties and the jurisdiction of any State.  Treaty with the Cherokee, Preamble,\\n\\n7Stat.\\n478.  This Court has instructed that tribal treaties must be interpreted as they would naturally be understood by the Indians at ratification.  Herrera v. Wyoming, 587 U.S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 19) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And having just lost their traditional homelands to Georgia, who can doubt that the Cherokee understood this promise as a guarantee that they would retain their sovereign authority over crimes by or against tribal members subject only to federal, not state, law?  That was certainly the contemporaneous understanding of the House Committee on Indian Affairs, which observed that [t]he United States and the Indian tribes [would be] the sole parties with power over new reservations in the West.  H. Rep. No. 474, at 18; see also Part IB, supra.  This Court has long shared the same view.  By treaties and statutes, the Court has said, the right of the Cherokee [N]ation to exist as an autonomous body, subject always to the paramount authority of the United States, has been recognized.  Talton v. Mayes,\\n\\n163 U.S. 376, 379380 (1896).[4] In 1906, Congress sought to deliver on its treaty promises when it adopted the Oklahoma Enabling Act.  That law paved the way for the new States admission to the Union.  But in doing so, Congress took care to require Oklahoma to agree and declare that it would forever disclaim all right and title in or to ... all lands lying within [the States] limits owned or held by any Indian, tribe, or nation.\\n\\n34Stat.\\n270.  Instead of granting the State some new power to prosecute crimes by or against tribal members, Congress insisted that tribal lands shall be and remain subject to the jurisdiction, disposal, and control of the United States.  Ibid.  Oklahoma complied with Congresss instructions by adopting both of these commitments verbatim in its Constitution.  Art. I,  3. Underscoring the nature of this arrangement, the Enabling Act further provided that nothing contained in the [Oklahoma] constitution shall be construed ... to limit or affect the authority of the Government of the United States to make any law or regulation respecting such Indians, their lands, property, or other rights by treaties, agreement, law, or otherwise, which it would have been competent to make if this Act had never been passed.\\n\\n34Stat.\\n267268 (emphasis added).  Prior to statehood, too, no one could have questioned Congresss exclusive authority to regulate tribal lands and affairs in the Oklahoma territory.  See, e.g., U.S. Const., Art.IV; Kagama, 118 U.S., at 380 (citing federal governments exclusive sovereignty over federal territories); Simms v. Simms,\\n\\n175 U.S. 162, 168 (1899) (In the Territories of the United States, Congress has the entire dominion and sovereignty, ... Federal and state); Harjo v. Kleppe, 420 F. Supp. 1110, 1121 (DC 1976) (federal courts had pre-statehood jurisdiction); Clinton 960962.  The Oklahoma Enabling Act and the commitments it demanded in the new Oklahoma Constitution sought to maintain this status quo. Recognizing the point, this Court has explained that, [i]n passing the enabling act for the admission of the State of Oklahoma ... Congress was careful to preserve the authority of the Government of the United States over the Indians, their lands and property, which it had prior to the passage of the act.  Tiger v. Western Investment Co.,\\n\\n221 U.S. 286, 309 (1911) (emphasis added).  This Court has explained, too, that the grant of statehood to Oklahoma did nothing to disturb the long-settled rule that the guardianship of the United States over Native American Tribes in Oklahoma has not been abandoned.  United States v. Ramsey,\\n\\n271 U.S. 467, 469 (1926).  Instead, this Court has acknowledged, the federal governments authority in respect of crimes committed by or against Indians continued after the admission of the state as it was before.  Ibid.  In fact, the Court has long interpreted nearly identical language in the Arizona Enabling Actenacted close in time to its Oklahoma counterpartas reinforcing the traditional rule that the States lac[k] jurisdiction on tribal lands over crimes by or against Native Americans.  McClanahan, 411 U.S., at 175; see also Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Commn,\\n\\n380 U.S. 685, 687, n. 3 (1965).[5] 4 The few occasions on which Congress has even arguably authorized the application of state criminal law on tribal reservations still do not come anywhere near granting Oklahoma the power it seeks.  In the late 1800s, this Court in McBratney and Draper held that federal statutes admitting certain States to the Union effectively meant those States could now prosecute crimes on tribal lands involving only non-Indians.  Yet, as aggressive as these decisions were, they took care to safeguard the rule that a States admission to the Union does not convey with it the power to punish crimes committed by or against Indians.  McBratney, 104 U.S., at 624; Draper, 164 U.S., at 247.  Indeed, soon after Oklahoma became a State, this Court explained that the grant of statehood may have endowed Oklahoma with authority to try crimes not committed by or against Indians, but with statehood did not come any authority to try crimes by or against Indians on tribal lands.  Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469; see also n.5, supra; Donnelly v. United States,\\n\\n228 U.S. 243, 271 (1913); Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S., at 220; Cohen 506509.  The decision whether and when this arrangement should cease rest[ed] with Congress alone.  Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469. The truth is, Congress has authorized the application of state criminal law on tribal lands for offenses committed by or against Native Americans only in very limited circumstances.  The most notable examples can be found in Public Law 280 and related statutes.  In 1940, Kansas successfully lobbied Congress for criminal jurisdiction in Indian country.  Nearly identical laws for North Dakota, Iowa, and New York followed close behind.  Then in 1953, Congress adopted Public Law 280 in which it authorized five States to exercise criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands and established procedures for additional States to assume similar authority.  In 1968, Congress amended Public Law 280.  Now, before a State like Oklahoma may try crimes by or against Native Americans arising on tribal lands, it must take action to amend any state law disclaiming that authority; then, the State must seek and obtain tribal consent to any extension of state jurisdiction.  See Part IB, supra; Clinton 958962.  Unless a State takes these steps, it does not hav[e] jurisdiction.  25 U.S.C. 1321(a), 1323(b).[6] 5 The Courts suggestion that Oklahoma enjoys inherent authority to try crimes against Native Americans within the Cherokee Reservation makes a mockery of all of Congresss work from 1834 to 1968.  The GCA and MCA?  On the Courts account, Congress foolishly extended federal criminal law to tribal lands on a mistaken assumption that only tribal law would otherwise apply.  Unknown to anyone until today, state law applied all along.  The treaty, the Oklahoma Enabling Act, and the provision in Oklahomas constitution that Congress insisted upon as a condition of statehood?  The Court effectively ignores them.  The Kansas Act and its sibling statutes?  On the Courts account, they were needless too.  Congresss instruction in Public Law 280 that States may not exercise jurisdiction over crimes by or against tribal members on tribal lands until they amend contrary state law and obtain tribal consent?  Once more, it seems the Court thinks Congress was hopelessly misguided.   Through it all, the Court makes no effort to grapple with the backdrop rule of tribal sovereignty.  The Court proceeds oblivious to the rule that only a clear act of Congress may impose constraints on tribal sovereignty.  The Court ignores the fact that Congress has never come close to subjecting the Cherokee to state criminal jurisdiction over crimes against tribal members within the Tribes reservation.  The Court even disregards our precedents recognizing that the grant of statehood to Oklahoma did not endow the State with any power to try crimes committed by or against Indians on tribal lands but reserved that authority to the federal government and Tribes alone.  Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469; see also Tiger, 221 U.S., at 309.  From start to finish, the Court defies our duty to interpret Congresss laws and our own prior work harmoniously as part of an entire corpus juris.  A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 252 (2012); see also Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller,\\n\\n486 U.S. 174, 184185 (1988). C Putting aside these astonishing errors, Congresss work and this Courts precedents yield three clear principles that firmly resolve this case.  First, tribal sovereign authority excludes the operation of other sovereigns criminal laws unless and until Congress ordains otherwise.  Second, while Congress has extended a good deal of federal criminal law to tribal lands, in Oklahoma it has authorized the State to prosecute crimes by or against Native Americans within tribal boundaries only if it satisfies certain requirements.  Under Public Law 280, the State must remove state-law barriers to jurisdiction and obtain tribal consent.  Third, because Oklahoma has done neither of these things, it lacks the authority it seeks to try crimes against tribal members within a tribal reservation.  Until today, all this settled law was well appreciated by this Court, the Executive Branch, and even Oklahoma. Consider first our own precedents and those of other courts.  In 1946 in Williams v. United States, this Court recognized that, while States may have jurisdiction over offenses committed on th[e] reservation between persons who are not Indians, the laws and courts of the United States, rather than those of [the States], have jurisdiction over offenses committed there ... by one who is not an Indian against one who is an Indian.\\n\\n327 U.S. 711, 714 (footnote omitted).  In Williams v. Lee, issued in 1959, this Court was clear again: [I]f the crime was by or against an Indian, tribal jurisdiction or that expressly conferred on other courts by Congress has remained exclusive.  358 U.S., at 220.  As early as 1926, this Court made the same point while speaking directly to Oklahoma.  Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469470.  It is a point our cases have continued to make in recent years.[7]  It is a point a host of other courtsincluding state courts issuing decisions contrary to their own interestshave acknowledged too.[8] The Executive Branch has likewise understood the States to lack authority to try crimes by or against Indians in Indian country absent congressional authorization.  Not only did the Washington Administration recognize as much.  See Part IA, supra.  The same view has persisted throughout the Nations history.  In 1940, the Acting Secretary of the Interior advised Congress that state criminal jurisdiction extends only to situations where both the offender and the victim are non-Indians.  S.Rep. No. 1523, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 2 (Vol. 2).  A few decades later, the Solicitor General made a similar representation to this Court.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Arizona v. Flint, O. T.   1988, No. 88603, p.3 (Flint Amicus Brief).  In McGirt, the federal government once more acknowledged that States cannot prosecute crimes by or against tribal members within still-extant tribal reservations.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in McGirt v. Oklahoma, O. T. 2019, No. 189526, p.38.  In this case, the government has espoused the same view yet again.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4; see also Dept. of Justice, Criminal Resource Manual 685 (updated Jan. 22, 2020).[9] In the past, even Oklahoma has more or less conceded the point.  The last time Oklahoma was before us, it asked this Court to usurp congressional authority and disestablish the Creek Reservation because, otherwise, the State would not have jurisdiction over crimes committed against Indians within its boundaries.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. in McGirt v. Oklahoma, No. 189526, O. T. 2019, p. 54; see also McGirt, 591 U.S., at ______ (slip op., at 3738).  In 1991, Oklahomas attorney general formally resolved that major [c]rimes committed by or against Indians ... are under the exclusive province of the United States, while Tribes retain exclusive jurisdiction over minor crimes committed by Indians.  Haney, 22 Okla. Opp. Atty. Gen. 71, 1991 WL 567868, *3. And Oklahomas own courts have recently taken the same position even in the face of vehement opposition from the States executive branch.  See, e.g., Spears, 485 P.3d, at 875, 877. D Against all this evidence, what is the Courts reply?  It acknowledges that, at the Nations founding, tribal sovereignty precluded States from prosecuting crimes on tribal lands by or against tribal members without congressional authorization.  See ante, at 5.  But the Court suggests this traditional notion flipped 180 degrees sometime in the latter half of the 1800s.  Ante, at 5, 21.  Since then, the Court says, Oklahoma has enjoyed the inherent power to try at least crimes by non-Indians against tribal members on tribal reservations until and unless Congress preempts state authority. But exactly when and how did this change happen?  The Court never explains.  Instead, the Court seeks to cast blame for its ruling on a grab bag of decisions issued by our predecessors.  But the failure of that effort is transparent.  Start with McBratney, which the Court describes as our leading case in the criminal context.  Ante, at 6.  There, as we have seen, the Court said that States admitted to the Union may gain the right to prosecute cases involving only non-Indians on tribal lands, but they do not gain any inherent right to punish crimes committed by or against Indians on tribal lands.  McBratney, 104 U.S., at 624.  The Courts reliance on Draper fares no better, for that case issued a similar disclaimer.  See 164 U.S., at 247.  Tellingly, not even Oklahoma thinks McBratney and Draper compel a ruling in its favor.  See Brief for Petitioner 12.  And if anything, the Courts invocation of Donnelly,\\n\\n228 U.S. 243, is more baffling still.  Ante, at 14, n.3. There, the Court once more reaffirmed the rule that offenses committed by or against Indians on tribal lands remain subject to federal, not state, jurisdiction.  Donnelly, 228 U.S., at 271; see also Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469. That leaves the Court to assemble a string of carefully curated snippetsa clause here, a sentence therefrom six decisions out of the galaxy of this Courts Indian law jurisprudence.  Ante, at 56.  But this collection of cases is no more at fault for the Courts decision than the last.  Organized Village of Kake v. Eganwhich the Court seems to think is some magic bullet, see ante, at 5, 14, n.2, 21, 2224addressed the prosaic question whether Alaska could apply its fishing laws on lands owned by a native Alaska tribal corporation.\\n\\n369 U.S. 60, 6163 (1962); see also n.5, supra.  Subsequently, the Court cabined that case to circumstances dealing with Indians who have left or never inhabited reservations set aside for their exclusive use or who do not possess the usual accoutrements of tribal self-government.  McClanahan, 411 U.S., at 167168.  Meanwhile, New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble allowed New York to use civil proceedings to eject non-Indian trespassers on Indian lands.  21 How. 366, 369371 (1859).  In Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook, the crime at issue did not take place on tribal lands but on a supply station of the United States sold by Arkansas to the federal government.\\n\\n281 U.S. 647, 649 (1930).  In New York exrel. Ray v. Martin, this Court merely reaffirmed McBratney and held that States could exercise jurisdiction over crimes involving only non-Indians.\\n\\n326 U.S. 496, 499500 (1946). Both County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation and Nevada v. Hicks issued holdings about state civil jurisdiction, not criminal jurisdiction striking at the heart of tribal sovereignty.  See\\n\\n502 U.S. 251, 256258, 270 (1992);\\n\\n533 U.S. 353, 361, 363, 374 (2001). In the end, the Court cannot fault our predecessors for todays decision.  The blame belongs only with this Court here and now.  Standing before us is a mountain of statutes and precedents making plain that Oklahoma possesses no authority to prosecute crimes against tribal members on tribal reservations until it amends its laws and wins tribal consent.  This Court may choose to ignore Congresss statutes and the Nations treaties, but it has no power to negate them.  The Court may choose to disregard our precedents, but it does not purport to overrule a single one.  As a result, todays decision surely marks an embarrassing new entry into the anticanon of Indian law.  But its mistakes need notand should notbe repeated. III Doubtless for some of these reasons, even the Court ultimately abandons its suggestion that Oklahoma is inherent[ly] free to prosecute crimes by non-Indians against tribal members on a tribal reservation absent a federal statute preempt[ing] its authority.  Ante, at 15.  In the end, the Court admits that tribal sovereignty can require the exclusion of state authority even absent a preemptive federal statute.  Ante, at 18.  But then, after correcting course, the Court veers off once more.  To determine whether tribal sovereignty displaces state authority in a case involving a non-Indian defendant and an Indian victim on a reservation in Oklahoma, the Court resorts to a Bracker balancing test.  Ibid.  Applying that test, the Court concludes that Oklahomas interests in this case outweigh those of the Cherokee.  All this, too, is mistaken root and branch. A Begin with the most fundamental problem. The Court invokes what it calls the Bracker balancing test with no more appreciation of that decisions history and context than it displays in its initial suggestion that the usual rules of preemption apply to Tribes.  The Court tells us nothing about Bracker itself, its reasoning, or its limits.  Perhaps understandably so, for Bracker never purported to claim for this Court the raw power to balance away tribal sovereignty in favor of state criminal jurisdiction over crimes by or against tribal memberslet alone ordain a wholly different set of jurisdictional rules than Congress already has. Bracker involved a relatively minor civil dispute.  Arizona sought to tax vehicles used by the White Mountain Apache Tribe in logging operations on tribal lands.  See Bracker, 448 U.S., at 138140.  The Tribe opposed the effort, pointing to a federal law that regulated tribal logging but did not say anything about preempting the States vehicle tax.  See id., at 141, 145.  The Court began by recognizing that the usual rules of preemption are not properly applied to Tribes.  Id., at 143.  Instead, the Court started with the traditional backdrop presumption that States lack jurisdiction in Indian country.  Ibid.  And the Court explained that any ambiguities about the scope of federal law must be construed generously in favor of the Tribes as sovereigns.  Id., at 143144.  With these rules in mind, the Court proceeded to turn back the States tax based on a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state, federal, and tribal interests at stake.  Id., at 145.  The Court judged that traditional notions of [tribal] sovereignty, the federal governments policy of promoting tribal self-sufficiency, and the rule requiring it to resolve [a]mbiguities in favor of the Tribe trumped any competing state interest.  Id., at 143144, 151. Nothing in any of this gets the Court close to where it wishes to go.  If Arizona had to proceed against the traditional backdrop rule excluding state jurisdiction, Oklahoma must.  And if Arizona could not overcome that backdrop rule because it could not point to clear federal statutory language authorizing its comparatively minor civil tax, it is unfathomable how Oklahoma might overcome that rule here.  The State has pointedand can pointto nothing in Congresss work granting it the power to try crimes against tribal members on a tribal reservation.  In Bracker, the Court found it instructive that Congress had comprehensive[ly] regulated the harvesting of Indian timber, even if it had not spoken directly to the question of vehicle taxes.  Id., at 145146, 148.  Here, Congress has not only pervasively regulated criminal jurisdiction in Indian country, it has spoken to the very situation we face:  States like Oklahoma may exercise jurisdiction over crimes within tribal boundaries by or against tribal members only with tribal consent. The simple truth is Bracker supplies zero authority for this Courts course today.  If Congress has not always been specific about the allocation of civil jurisdiction in Indian country, the same can hardly be said about the allocation of criminal authority.  Cohen 527.  Congress has provided a nearly comprehensive set of statutes allocating criminal jurisdiction.  Ibid.  In doing so, Congress has already balanced competing tribal, state, and federal interestsand its balance demands tribal consent.  Exactly nothing in Bracker permits us to ignore Congresss directive. B Plainly, the Courts balancing-test game is not one we should be playing in this case.  But what if we did?  Suppose this Court could (somehow) ignore Congresss decision to allow States like Oklahoma to exercise criminal jurisdiction in cases like ours only with tribal consent.  Suppose we could (somehow) replace that rule with one of our own creation.  Even proceeding on that stunning premise, it is far from obvious how the Court arrives at its preferred result. In reweighing competing state and tribal interests for itself, the Court stresses two points.  First, the Court suggests that its balance is designed to help Native Americans.  Ante, at 20 (suggesting that Indians would be second-class citizens without this Courts intervention); Tr. of Oral Arg. 66 (suggesting state jurisdiction is designed to help tribal members). Second, the Court says state jurisdiction is needed on the Cherokee Reservation today because in the wake of McGirt some defendants have simply gone free.  Ante, at 34.  On both counts, however, the Court conspicuously loads the dice. 1 Start with the assertion that allowing state prosecutions in cases like ours will help Indians.  The old paternalist overtones are hard to ignore.  Yes, under the laws Congress has ordained Oklahoma may acquire jurisdiction over crimes by or against tribal members only with tribal consent.  But to date, the Cherokee have misguidedly shown no interest in state jursidiction.  Thanks to their misjudgment, they have rendered themselves second-class citizens.  Ante, at 20. So, the argument goes, five unelected judges in Washington must now make the right choice for the Tribe.  To state the Courts staggering argument should be enough to refute it. Nor does the Court even pause to consider some of the reasons why the Cherokee might not be so eager to invite state prosecutions in cases like ours.  Maybe the Cherokee have so far withheld their consent because, throughout the Nations history, state governments have sometimes proven less than reliable sources of justice for Indian victims.  As early as 1795, George Washington observed that a Jury on the frontiers considering a crime by a non-Indian against an Indian could hardly be got to listen to a charge, much less to convict a culprit.  Letter to E. Pendleton (Jan. 22), in 17 Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 424, 426 (D. Hoth & C. Ebel eds. 2013).  Undoubtedly, too, Georgia once proved among the Cherokees deadliest enemies.  Kagama, 118 U.S., at 384. Maybe the Cherokee also have in mind experiences particular to Oklahoma.  Following statehood, settlers embarked on elaborate schemes to deprive Indians of their lands, rents, and mineral rights.  Many young allottees were virtually kidnaped just before they reached their majority; some were induced to sign deeds at midnight on the morning they became of age.  Debo 197198.  Others were subjected to predatory guardianships; state judges even reward[ed] their supporters [with] guardianship appointments.  Id., at 183.  Oklahomas courts also sometimes sanctioned the legalized robbery of these Native American children through the probate courts.  Id., at 182.  Even almost a century on, the federal government warned of the possibility of prejudice [against Native Americans] in state courts.  Flint Amicus Brief 5. Whatever may have happened in the past, it seems the Court can imagine only a bright new day ahead.  Moving forward, the Court cheerily promises, more prosecuting authorities can only help.  Three sets of prosecutorsfederal, tribal, and stateare sure to prove better than two.  But again its not hard to imagine reasons why the Cherokee might see things differently.  If more sets of prosecutors are always better, why not allow Texas to enforce its laws in California?  Few sovereigns or their citizens would see that as an improvement.  Yet it seems the Court cannot grasp why the Tribe may not. The Court also neglects to consider actual experience with concurrent state jurisdiction on tribal lands.  According to a group of former United States Attorneys, in practice concurrent jurisdiction has sometimes create[d] a pass-the-buck dynamic ... with the end result being fewer police and more crime.  Brief for Former United States Attorneys etal. as Amici Curiae 13; see also C. Goldberg, Public Law 280: The Limits of State Jurisdiction Over Reservation Indians, 22 UCLA L. Rev. 535, 552, and n.92 (1975); Goldberg-Ambrose 1423.  Federal authorities may reduce their involvement when state authorities are present.  In turn, some States may not wish to devote the resources required and may view the responsibility as an unfunded federal mandate.  Thanks to realities like these, [a]lmost as soon as Congress began granting States [criminal] jurisdiction through Public Law 280, affected Tribal Nations began seeking retrocession and repeal.  Brief for National Indigenous Womens Resource Center et al. as Amici Curiae 12.  Recently, a bipartisan congressional commission agreed that more state criminal jurisdiction in Indian country is often not a good policy choice.  See Indian Law and Order Commission, A Roadmap for Making Native America Safer: Report to the President and Congress of the United States xi, xiv, 1115 (Nov. 2013).  Still, none of this finds its way into the Courts cost-benefit analysis. 2 Instead, the Court marches on.  The second factor it weighs in its balanceand the only history it seems interested in consultingconcerns Oklahomas account of its experiences in the last two years since McGirt.  Adopting the States representations wholesale, the Court says that decision has posed Oklahoma with law-and-order challenge[s].  Ante, at 4.  To support its thesis, the Court cites the States unsubstantiated estimat[e] that McGirt has forced it to transfer prosecutorial responsibility for more than 18,000 cases per year to federal and tribal authorities.  Ibid.  Apparently on the belief that the transfer of cases from state to federal prosecutors equates to an eruption of chaos and criminality, the Court remarks casually that traditional limitations on state prosecutorial authority on tribal lands were insignificant in the real world before McGirt.  Ante, at 16. But what does this prove?  Put aside for the moment questions about the accuracy of Oklahomas statistics and what the number of cases transferred from state to federal prosecutors may or may not mean for law and order.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26 (questioning whether the States figures might be grossly exaggerated).  Taking the Courts account at face value, it might amount to a reason for Oklahoma to lobby the Cherokee to consent to state jurisdiction.  It might be a reason for the State to petition Congress to revise criminal jurisdictional arrangements in the State even without tribal consent.  But it is no act of statutory or constitutional interpretation.  It is a policy argument through and through. Nor is the Courts policy argument exactly complete in its assessment of the costs and benefits.  When this Court issued McGirt, it expressly acknowledged that cases involving crimes by or against tribal members within reservation boundaries would have to be transferred from state to tribal or federal authorities.  591 U.S., at ______ (slip op., at 3642).  This Court anticipated, too, that this process would require a period of readjustment.  But, the Court recognized, all this was necessary only because Oklahoma had long overreached its authority on tribal reservations and defied legally binding congressional promises.  See ibid. Notably, too, neither the tribal nor the federal authorities on the receiving end of this new workload think the costs of this period of readjustment begin to justify the Courts course.  For their part, Tribes in Oklahoma have hired more police officers, prosecutors, and judges.  See Cherokee Brief 1011.  Based on that investment, Oklahomas Tribes have begun to prosecute substantially more cases than they once did.  See id., at 1213.  And they have also shown a willingness to work with Oklahoma, having signed hundreds of cross-deputization agreements allowing local law enforcement to collaborate with tribal police.  Id., at 1516, and n.39.  Even Oklahomas amici concede these agreements have proved an important tool for law enforcement.  Brief for Oklahoma District Attorneys Association etal. as Amici Curiae 14. Both of the federal governments elected branches have also responded, if not in the way this Court happens to prefer.  Instead of forcing state criminal jurisdiction onto Tribes, Congress has chosen to allocate additional funds for law enforcement in Oklahoma.  See, e.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, H.R. 2471, 117th Cong., 2d Sess., 78 (2022).  Meanwhile, the Solicitor General has offered the Executive Branchs judgment that McGirts practical consequences do not justify this Courts intervention, explaining that the Department of Justice is working diligently with tribal and State partners in Oklahoma.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 32. There is even more evidence cutting against the Courts dystopian tale.  According to a recent United States Attorney in Oklahoma, the sky isnt falling and partnerships between tribal law enforcement and state law enforcement are strong.  A.Herrera, Trent Shores Reflects on His Time as U.S. Attorney, Remains Committed to Justice for Indian Country, KOSU-NPR (Feb. 24, 2021), www.kosu.org/politics/2021-02-24/trent-shores-reflects-on-his-time-as-u-s-attorney-remains-committed-to-justice-for-indian-country.  A Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent in charge of Oklahoma has stated that violent crimes are being pursued as heavily as they were in the past, and in some cases, maybe even stronger.  A. Brothers, Oklahoma Special Agent Says FBI Faces Challenges in 3 Categories, News on 6 (Feb. 14, 2022),https://www.newson6.com/story/620b261bf8cd4a07e5cb845b/oklahoma-special-agent-says-fbi-faces-challenges-in-3-categories.  And the Tribesthose most affected by all this supposed lawlessness within their reservationstell us that, after a period of adjustment, federal prosecutors are now pursuing lower level offenses vigorously too.  See Brief for Muscogee (Creek) Nation as Amicus Curiae on Pet. for Cert. 1112, and nn.2122 (collecting indictments).  The federal government has made a similar representation to this Court.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 118.  Nor is it any secret that those convicted of federal crimes generally receive longer sentences than individuals convicted of similar state offenses.  See, e.g., Bureau of Justice Statistics, Felony Sentences in State Courts, 2006Statistical Tables 9 (2009) (Table 1.6). In recounting all this, I do not profess certainty about the optimal law enforcement arrangements in Oklahoma.  I do not pretend to know all the relevant facts, let alone how to balance each of them in this complex picture.  Nor do I claim to know what weight to give historical wrongs or future hopes.  I offer the preceding observations only to illustrate the one thing I am sure of:  This Court has no business usurping congressional decisions about the appropriate balance between federal, tribal, and state interests.  If the Courts ruling today sounds like a legislative committee report touting the benefits of some newly proposed bill, thats because it is exactly that.  And given that a nine-member court is a poor substitute for the peoples elected representatives, it is no surprise that the Courts cost-benefit analysis is radically incomplete.  The Courts decision is not a judicial interpretation of the laws meaning; it is the pastiche of a legislative process. C As unsound as the Courts decision is, it would be a mistake to overlook its limits.  In the end, the Court admits that tribal sovereignty can displace state authority even without a preemptive statute.  See Part IIIA, supra.  To be sure, the Court proceeds to disparage a federal statute requiring Oklahoma to obtain tribal consent before trying any crime involving an Indian victim within the Cherokee Reservation.  But look at what the Court leaves unresolved.  The Court does not pass on Public Law 280s provision that States shall not be entitled to assume jurisdiction on tribal lands until they appropriately amen[d] state laws disclaiming authority over tribal reservations.\\n\\n25 U.S.C.  1324.  The Court gestures toward the Cherokees treaties and the Oklahoma Enabling Act, but ultimately abandons any argument that those treaties were lawfully abrogated or that the Oklahoma Enabling Act endowed Oklahoma with inherent authority to try cases involving Native Americans within tribal bounds.  See ante, at 18. Nor does the Court address the relevant text of those treaties or the Enabling Actlet alone come to terms with our precedents holding that Oklahomas grant of statehood did not include the power to try crimes committed by or against Indians on tribal lands.  Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469; see also Tiger, 221 U.S., at 309.  Nothing in todays decision could or does begin to preclude the Cherokee or other Tribes from pressing arguments along any of these lines in future cases.  The unamended Oklahoma Constitution and other state statutes and judicial decisions may stand as independent barriers to the assumption of state jurisdiction as a matter of state law too. The Courts decision is limited in still other important ways.  Most significantly, the Court leaves undisturbed the ancient rule that States cannot prosecute crimes by Native Americans on tribal lands without clear congressional authorizationfor that would touch the heart of tribal self-government.  Ante, at 17.  At least that rule (and maybe others) can never be balanced away.  Indeed, the Courts ruling today rests in significant part on the fact that Tribes currently lack criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians who commit crimes on tribal landsa factor that obviously does not apply to cases involving Native American defendants.  Ante, at 19. Additionally, nothing in the Bracker balancing test the Court employs foreordains todays grim result for different Tribes in different States.  Bracker instructs courts to focus on the specific context at issue, taking cognizance of the particular circumstances of the Tribe in question, including all relevant treaties and statutes.  448 U.S., at 145.  Nor are Tribes and their treaties fungible.  S.Prakash, Against Tribal Fungibility, 89 Cornell L. Rev. 1069, 10711072 (2004).  There are nearly 600 federally recognized Indian Tribes across the country.  See Anderson 3.  Some of their treaties appear to promise tribal freedom from state criminal jurisdiction in express terms.  See, e.g., Treaty with the Navajo, Art. I, June 1868,\\n\\n15Stat.\\n667 (guaranteeing that those who commit crimes against tribal members will be arrested and punished according to the laws of the United States).  Any analysis true to Bracker must take cognizance of all of this.  Any such analysis must recognize, too, that the standards of preemption applicable in other areas of the law are unhelpful when it comes to Tribes.  Bracker, 448 U.S., at 143.  Instead, courts must proceed against the backdrop of tribal sovereignty, ibid., with an assumption that the States have no power to regulate the affairs of Indians on a reservation or other tribal lands, Williams, 358 U.S., at 219220.  To overcome that backdrop assumption, a clear congressional statement is required and any ambiguities must be construed generously in favor of the Tribes.  Bracker, 448 U.S., at 143144; see also Cotton Petroleum, 490 U.S., at 177178.  The Court today may ignore a clear jurisdictional rule prescribed by statute and choose to apply its own balancing test instead.  The Court may misapply that balancing test in an effort to address one States professed law and order concerns.  In the process, the Court may even risk unsettling longstanding and clear jurisdictional rules nationwide.  But in the end, any faithful application of Bracker to other Tribes in other States should only confirm the soundness of the traditional rule that state authorities may not try crimes like this one absent congressional authorization.[10] Nor must Congress stand by as this Court sows needless confusion across the country.  Even the Court acknowledges that Congress can undo its decision and preempt state authority at any time.  Ante, at 6.  And Congress could do exactly that with a simple amendment to Public Law 280.  It might say:  A State lacks criminal jurisdiction over crimes by or against Indians in Indian Country, unless the State complies with the procedures to obtain tribal consent outlined in\\n\\n25 U.S.C.  1321, and, where necessary, amends its constitution or statutes pursuant to\\n\\n25 U.S.C.  1324.  Of course, that reminder of the obvious should hardly be necessary.  But thanks to this Courts egregious misappropriation of legislative authority, the ball is back in Congress court.  Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.,\\n\\n550 U.S. 618, 661 (2007) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). * In the 1830s, this Court struggled to keep our Nations promises to the Cherokee.  Justice Story celebrated the decision in Worcester: [T]hanks be to God, the Court can wash [its] hands clean of the iniquity of oppressing the Indians and disregarding their rights.  Breyer 420.  The Court had done its duty, even if Georgia refused to do its own.  Ibid.  Today, the tables turn.  Oklahomas courts exercised the fortitude to stand athwart their own States lawless disregard of the Cherokees sovereignty.  Now, at the bidding of Oklahomas executive branch, this Court unravels those lower-court decisions, defies Congresss statutes requiring tribal consent, offers its own consent in place of the Tribes, and allows Oklahoma to intrude on a feature of tribal sovereignty recognized since the founding.  One can only hope the political branches and future courts will do their duty to honor this Nations promises even as we have failed today to do our own.']\n"]}],"source":["# we can see that opinion is

Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., Inc., 2200 U.S. 321, 337. SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of oklahoma No. 21429.Argued April 27, 2022Decided June 29, 2022 In 2015, respondent Victor Manuel Castro- Huerta was charged by the State of Oklahoma for child neglect.  He was convicted in state court and sentenced to 35 years of imprisonment.  While Castro-Hertas state-court appeal was pending, this Court decided McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U. S. ___.  There, the Court held that the Creek Nations reservation in eastern Oklahoma had never been properly disestablished and therefore remained Indian country.  Id., at ___. . In light of McGirt, the eastern part of Oklahoma, including Tulsa, is recognized as Indian country, and thus is recognized by the United States.  In this development, Castro-Wei was convicted of child neglect in Oklahoma. He was sentenced to 25 years in state prison. He appealed to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.  The Court agreed and vacated his conviction. The Court also vacated the conviction of his stepdaughter (a Cherokee Indian) in Tulsa (Indian country) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Id., in the same manner as McGirt. At ____.  In the case, he appealed again to the Supreme Court of Oklahoma. The Supreme Court affirmed his conviction and vacated the remainder of his sentence.  Pp.425. (a)The jurisdictional dispute in this case arises because Oklahomas territory (a non-Indian) for a crime committed against his stepfather (a Chero Indian) and that the State therefore lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him.  But that the Court then lacked jurisdiction, and the Court agreed to the State.  This Court of the Oklahoma Supreme Court.  United States has jurisdiction to determine the extent of a States jurisdiction to prosecuting crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country and that jurisdiction is preempted by the Federal Government. Pp.424. (b)Castro-Huesta argued that the federal Government had exclusive jurisdiction to investigate crimes committed against Indians against Indians.  O.K. and that Oklahomans territory includes Indian country in the early Republic.  It has long since been abandoned. The Federal Government sometimes treated Indian country as separate from state territory.  See Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 515.  And that view has longSince been abandoned, Organized Village of Kake v. Egan, 7 Pet. 621, 619, 621.

Castro-Huerta certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of oklahoma No. 21429.Argued April 27, 2022Decided June 29, 2022 In 2015, respondent Victor Manuel Castro-Huerta was charged by the State of Oklahoma for child neglect.  Castro-Huerta was convicted in state court and sentenced to 35 years of imprisonment.  While Castro-Huertas state-court appeal was pending, this Court decided McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U.S. ___.  There, the Court held that the Creek Nations reservation in eastern Oklahoma had never been properly disestablished and therefore remained Indian country.  Id., at ___.  In light of McGirt, the eastern part of Oklahoma, including Tulsa, is recognized as Indian country.  Following this development, Castro-Huerta argued that the Federal Government had exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute him (a non-Indian) for a crime committed against his stepdaughter (a Cherokee Indian) in Tulsa (Indian country), and that the State therefore lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him.  The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals agreed and vacated his conviction.  This Court granted certiorari to determine the extent of a States jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. Held:The Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  Pp.425. (a)The jurisdictional dispute in this case arises because Oklahomas territory includes Indian country.  In the early Republic, the Federal Government sometimes treated Indian country as separate from state territory.  See Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515.  But that view has long since been abandoned. Organized Village of Kake v. Egan,\\n369 U.S. 60, 72.  And the Court has specifically held that States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against non-Indians in Indian country.  United States v. McBratney,\\n104 U.S. 621; see also Draper v. United States,\\n164 U.S. 240, 244247.  Accordingly, States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in Indian country unless preempted.  Pp.46.   (b)Under Court precedent, a States jurisdiction in Indian country may be preempted by federal law under ordinary principles of federal preemption, or when the exercise of state jurisdiction would unlawfully infringe on tribal self-government.  Neither serves to preempt state jurisdiction in this case.  Pp.620. (1)Castro-Huerta points to two federal lawsthe General Crimes Act and Public Law 280that, in his view, preempt Oklahomas authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  Neither statute, however, preempts the States jurisdiction.  Pp.718. (i)The General Crimes Act does not preempt state authority to prosecute Castro-Huertas crime.  It provides that the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed ... within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States ... shall extend to the Indian country.\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1152.  By its terms, the Act simply extend[s] the federal laws that apply on federal enclaves to Indian country.  The Act does not say that Indian country is equivalent to a federal enclave for jurisdictional purposes, that federal jurisdiction is exclusive in Indian country, or that state jurisdiction is preempted in Indian country. Castro-Huerta claims that the General Crimes Act does indeed make Indian country the jurisdictional equivalent of a federal enclave.  Castro-Huerta is wrong as a matter of text and precedent. Pointing to the history of territorial separation and Congresss reenactment of the General Crimes Act after this Court suggested in dicta in Williams v. United States,\\n327 U.S. 711, 714, that States lack jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country, Castro-Huerta argues that Congress implicitly intended for the Act to provide the Federal Government with exclusive jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  But the text of the Act says no such thing; the idea of territorial separation has long since been abandoned; and the reenactment canon cannot be invoked to override clear statutory language of the kind present in the General Crimes Act.  Castro-Huerta notes that the Court has repeated the Williams dicta on subsequent occasions, but even repeated dicta does not constitute precedent and does not alter the plain text of the General Crimes Act.  Pp.716. (ii)Castro-Huertas attempt to invoke Public Law 280,\\n\\n67Stat.\\n588, is also unpersuasive.  That law affirmatively grants certain States (and allows other States to acquire) broad jurisdiction to prosecute state-law offenses committed by or against Indians in Indian country.  \\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1162;\\n\\n25 U.S.C. 1321.  Castro-Huerta contends that the laws enactment in 1953 would have been pointless surplusage if States already had concurrent jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  But Public Law 280 contains no language preempting state jurisdiction.  And Public Law 280 encompasses far more than just non-Indian on Indian crimes.  Thus, resolution of the narrow jurisdictional issue here does not negate the significance of Public Law 280.  Pp.1618. (2)The test articulated in White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker,\\n448 U.S. 136, does not bar the State from prosecuting crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  There, the Court held that even when federal law does not preempt state jurisdiction under ordinary preemption analysis, preemption may still occur if the exercise of state jurisdiction would unlawfully infringe upon tribal self-government.  Id., at 142143.  Under Brackers balancing test, the Court considers tribal interests, federal interests, and state interests.  Id., at 145.  Here, the exercise of state jurisdiction would not infringe on tribal self-government.  And because a States jurisdiction is concurrent with federal jurisdiction, a state prosecution would not preclude an earlier or later federal prosecution.  Finally, the State has a strong sovereign interest in ensuring public safety and criminal justice within its territory, including an interest in protecting both Indian and non-Indian crime victims.  Pp.1820. (c)This Court has long held that Indian country is part of a State, not separate from it.  Under the Constitution, States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes within their territory except when preempted by federal law or by principles of tribal self-government.  The default is that States have criminal jurisdiction in Indian country unless that jurisdiction is preempted.  And that jurisdiction has not been preempted here. Pp. 2125. Reversed and remanded.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21429 _________________ OKLAHOMA, PETITIONER v. VICTOR MANUEL CASTRO-HUERTA on writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of oklahoma [June 29, 2022]  Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the Court. This case presents a jurisdictional question about the prosecution of crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country:  Under current federal law, does the Federal Government have exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute those crimes?  Or do the Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute those crimes?  We conclude that the Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. I In 2015, Victor Manuel Castro-Huerta lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with his wife and their several children, including Castro-Huertas then-5-year-old stepdaughter, who is a Cherokee Indian.  The stepdaughter has cerebral palsy and is legally blind.  One day in 2015, Castro-Huertas sister-in-law was in the house and noticed that the young girl was sick.  After a 911 call, the girl was rushed to a Tulsa hospital in critical condition.  Dehydrated, emaciated, and covered in lice and excrement, she weighed only 19 pounds.  Investigators later found her bed filled with bedbugs and cockroaches. When questioned, Castro-Huerta admitted that he had severely undernourished his stepdaughter during the preceding month.  The State of Oklahoma criminally charged both Castro-Huerta and his wife for child neglect.  Both were convicted.  Castro-Huerta was sentenced to 35 years of imprisonment, with the possibility of parole.  This case concerns the States prosecution of Castro-Huerta. After Castro-Huerta was convicted and while his appeal was pending in state court, this Court decided McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U.S. ___ (2020).  In McGirt, the Court held that Congress had never properly disestablished the Creek Nations reservation in eastern Oklahoma.  As a result, the Court concluded that the Creek Reservation remained Indian country.  Id., at ______, ___, ___ (slip op., at 13, 17, 28).  The status of that part of Oklahoma as Indian country meant that different jurisdictional rules might apply for the prosecution of criminal offenses in that area.  See 18 U.S.C. 11511153.  Based on McGirts reasoning, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals later recognized that several other Indian reservations in Oklahoma had likewise never been properly disestablished.  See, e.g., State exrel. Matloff v. Wallace, 2021 OK CR 21, 15, 497 P.3d 686, 689 (reaffirming recognition of the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Reservations); Grayson v. State, 2021 OK CR 8, 10, 485 P.3d 250, 254 (Seminole Reservation). In light of McGirt and the follow-on cases, the eastern part of Oklahoma, including Tulsa, is now recognized as Indian country.  About two million people live there, and the vast majority are not Indians. The classification of eastern Oklahoma as Indian country has raised urgent questions about which government or governments have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed there.  This case is an example:  a crime committed in what is now recognized as Indian country (Tulsa) by a non-Indian (Castro-Huerta) against an Indian (his stepdaughter).  All agree that the Federal Government has jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  The question is whether the Federal Governments jurisdiction is exclusive, or whether the State also has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Government. In the wake of McGirt, Castro-Huerta argued that the Federal Governments jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by a non-Indian against an Indian in Indian country is exclusive and that the State therefore lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him.  The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals agreed with Castro-Huerta.  Relying on an earlier Oklahoma decision holding that the federal General Crimes Act grants the Federal Government exclusive jurisdiction, the court ruled that the State did not have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  The court therefore vacated Castro-Huertas conviction.  No. F20171203 (Apr. 29, 2021); see also Bosse v. State, 2021 OK CR 3, 484 P.3d 286; Roth v. State, 2021 OK CR 27, 499 P.3d 23. While Castro-Huertas state appellate proceedings were ongoing, a federal grand jury in Oklahoma indicted Castro-Huerta for the same conduct.  Castro-Huerta accepted a plea agreement for a 7-year sentence followed by removal from the United States.  (Castro-Huerta is not a U.S. citizen and is unlawfully in the United States.)  In other words, putting aside parole possibilities, Castro-Huerta in effect received a 28-year reduction of his sentence as a result of McGirt. Castro-Huertas case exemplifies a now-familiar pattern in Oklahoma in the wake of McGirt.  The Oklahoma courts have reversed numerous state convictions on that same jurisdictional ground.  After having their state convictions reversed, some non-Indian criminals have received lighter sentences in plea deals negotiated with the Federal Government.  Others have simply gone free.  Going forward, the State estimates that it will have to transfer prosecutorial responsibility for more than 18,000 cases per year to the Federal and Tribal Governments.  All of this has created a significant challenge for the Federal Government and for the people of Oklahoma.  At the end of fiscal year 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice was opening only 22% and 31% of all felony referrals in the Eastern and Northern Districts of Oklahoma.  Dept. of Justice, U.S. Attorneys, Fiscal Year 2023 Congressional Justification 46.  And the Department recently acknowledged that many people may not be held accountable for their criminal conduct due to resource constraints.  Ibid. In light of the sudden significance of this jurisdictional question for public safety and the criminal justice system in Oklahoma, this Court granted certiorari to decide whether a State has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Government to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  595 U.S. ___ (2022).[1] II The jurisdictional dispute in this case arises because Oklahomas territory includes Indian country.  Federal law defines Indian country to include, among other things, all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government.\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1151. To begin with, the Constitution allows a State to exercise jurisdiction in Indian country.  Indian country is part of the State, not separate from the State.  To be sure, under this Courts precedents, federal law may preempt that state jurisdiction in certain circumstances.  But otherwise, as a matter of state sovereignty, a State has jurisdiction over all of its territory, including Indian country.  See U.S. Const., Amdt. 10.  As this Court has phrased it, a State is generally entitled to the sovereignty and jurisdiction over all the territory within her limits.  Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 228 (1845). In the early years of the Republic, the Federal Government sometimes treated Indian country as separate from state territoryin the same way that, for example, New Jersey is separate from New York.  Most prominently, in the 1832 decision in Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 561, this Court held that Georgia state law had no force in the Cherokee Nation because the Cherokee Nation is a distinct community occupying its own territory. But the general notion drawn from Chief Justice Marshalls opinion in Worcester v. Georgia has yielded to closer analysis.  Organized Village of Kake v. Egan,\\n\\n369 U.S. 60, 72 (1962).  By 1880 the Court no longer viewed reservations as distinct nations.  Ibid.  Since the latter half of the 1800s, the Court has consistently and explicitly held that Indian reservations are part of the surrounding State and subject to the States jurisdiction except as forbidden by federal law.  Ibid. To take a few examples:  In 1859, the Court stated:  States retain the power of a sovereign over their persons and property, so far as necessary to preserve the peace of the Commonwealth.  New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble, 21 How. 366, 370 (1859). In 1930:  [R]eservations are part of the State within which they lie and her laws, civil and criminal, have the same force therein as elsewhere within her limits, save that they can have only restricted application to the Indian wards.  Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook,\\n\\n281 U.S. 647, 651 (1930). In 1946:  [I]n the absence of a limiting treaty obligation or Congressional enactment each state ha[s] a right to exercise jurisdiction over Indian reservations within its boundaries.  New York ex rel. Ray v. Martin,\\n\\n326 U.S. 496, 499 (1946). In 1992:  This Courts more recent cases have recognized the rights of States, absent a congressional prohibition, to exercise criminal (and, implicitly, civil) jurisdiction over non-Indians located on reservation lands.  County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation,\\n\\n502 U.S. 251, 257258 (1992). And as recently as 2001:  State sovereignty does not end at a reservations border.  Nevada v. Hicks,\\n\\n533 U.S. 353, 361 (2001). In accord with that overarching jurisdictional principle dating back to the 1800s, States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in Indian country unless preempted.  In the leading case in the criminal contextthe McBratney case from 1882this Court held that States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against non-Indians in Indian country.  United States v. McBratney, \\n104 U.S. 621, 623624 (1882).  The Court stated that Colorado had criminal jurisdiction over crimes by non-Indians against non-Indians throughout the whole of the territory within its limits, including the Ute Reservation.  Id., at 624.  Several years later, the Court similarly decided that Montana had criminal jurisdiction over crimes by non-Indians against non-Indians in Indian country within that State.  Draper v. United States,\\n\\n164 U.S. 240, 244247 (1896).  The McBratney principle remains good law. In short, the Courts precedents establish that Indian country is part of a States territory and that, unless preempted, States have jurisdiction over crimes committed in Indian country. III The central question that we must decide, therefore, is whether the States authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country has been preempted.  U. S. Const., Art.VI. Under the Courts precedents, as we will explain, a States jurisdiction in Indian country may be preempted (i)by federal law under ordinary principles of federal preemption, or (ii) when the exercise of state jurisdiction would unlawfully infringe on tribal self-government. In Part IIIA, we consider whether state authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country is preempted by federal law under ordinary principles of preemption.  In Part IIIB, we consider whether principles of tribal self-government preclude the exercise of state jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. A Castro-Huerta points to two federal laws that, in his view, preempt Oklahomas authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country: (i) the General Crimes Act, which grants the Federal Government jurisdiction to prosecute crimes in Indian country,\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1152; and (ii) Public Law 280, which grants States, or authorizes States to acquire, certain additional jurisdiction over crimes committed in Indian country,\\n\\n67Stat.\\n588; see\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1162;\\n\\n25 U.S.C. 1321.  Neither statute preempts preexisting or otherwise lawfully assumed state authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. 1 As relevant here, the General Crimes Act provides:  Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, except the District of Columbia, shall extend to the Indian country.\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1152. By its terms, the Act does not preempt the States authority to prosecute non-Indians who commit crimes against Indians in Indian country.  The text of the Act simply extend[s] federal law to Indian country, leaving untouched the background principle of state jurisdiction over crimes committed within the State, including in Indian country.  Ibid. The Act also specifies the body of federal criminal law that extends to Indian countrynamely, the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.  Ibid.  Those cross-referenced general laws are the federal laws that apply in federal enclaves such as military bases and national parks.  Ibid. Importantly, however, the General Crimes Act does not say that Indian country is equivalent to a federal enclave for jurisdictional purposes.  Nor does the Act say that federal jurisdiction is exclusive in Indian country, or that state jurisdiction is preempted in Indian country. Under the General Crimes Act, therefore, both the Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in Indian country.[2]  The General Crimes Act does not preempt state authority to prosecute Castro-Huertas crime. To overcome the text, Castro-Huerta offers several counterarguments.  None is persuasive. First, Castro-Huerta advances what he describes as a textual argument.  He contends that the text of the General Crimes Act makes Indian country the jurisdictional equivalent of a federal enclave.  To begin, he points out that the Federal Government has exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in federal enclaves such as military bases and national parks.  And then Castro-Huerta asserts that the General Crimes Act in effect equates federal enclaves and Indian country.  Therefore, according to Castro-Huerta, it follows that the Federal Government also has exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in Indian country. Castro-Huertas syllogism is wrong as a textual matter.  The Act simply borrows the body of federal criminal law that applies in federal enclaves and extends it to Indian country.  The Act does not purport to equate Indian country and federal enclaves for jurisdictional purposes.  Moreover, it is not enough to speculate, as Castro-Huerta does, that Congress might have implicitly intended a jurisdictional parallel between Indian country and federal enclaves. Castro-Huertas argument also directly contradicts this Courts precedents.  As far back as 1891, the Court stated that the phrase sole and exclusive jurisdiction in the General Crimes Act is only used in the description of the laws which are extended to Indian country, not to the jurisdiction extended over the Indian country.  In re Wilson,\\n\\n140 U.S. 575, 578 (1891).  The Court repeated that analysis in 1913, concluding that the phrase sole and exclusive jurisdiction is used in order to describe the laws of the United States which by that section are extended to the Indian country.  Donnelly v. United States, \\n228 U.S. 243, 268 (1913). Stated otherwise, the General Crimes Act provides that the federal criminal laws that apply to federal enclaves also apply in Indian country.  But the extension of those federal laws to Indian country does not silently erase preexisting or otherwise lawfully assumed state jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians in Indian country. Moreover, if Castro-Huertas interpretation of the General Crimes Act were correct, then the Act would preclude States from prosecuting any crimes in Indian countrypresumably even those crimes committed by non-Indians against non-Indiansjust as States ordinarily cannot prosecute crimes committed in federal enclaves.  But this Court has long held that States may prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against non-Indians in Indian country.  See McBratney, 104 U.S., at 623624; Draper, 164 U.S., at 242246.  Those holdings, too, contravene Castro-Huertas argument regarding the General Crimes Act. In advancing his enclave argument, Castro-Huerta also tries to analogize the text of the General Crimes Act to the text of the Major Crimes Act.  He asserts that the Major Crimes Act grants the Federal Government exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute certain major crimes committed by Indians in Indian country.  But the Major Crimes Act contains substantially different language than the General Crimes Act.  Unlike the General Crimes Act, the Major Crimes Act says that defendants in Indian country shall be subject to the same law as defendants in federal enclaves.  See\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1153 (Any Indian who commits against the person or property of another Indian or other person any of certain major offenses shall be subject to the same law and penalties as all other persons committing any of the above offenses, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States).  So even assuming that the text of the Major Crimes Act provides for exclusive federal jurisdiction over major crimes committed by Indians in Indian country, see, e.g., United States v. John,\\n\\n437 U.S. 634, 651, and n. 22 (1978); Negonsott v. Samuels,\\n\\n507 U.S. 99, 103 (1993), that conclusion does not translate to the differently worded General Crimes Act. In short, the General Crimes Act does not treat Indian country as the equivalent of a federal enclave for jurisdictional purposes.  Nor does the Act make federal jurisdiction exclusive or preempt state law in Indian country. Second, Castro-Huerta contends that, regardless of the statutory text, Congress implicitly intended for the General Crimes Act to provide the Federal Government with exclusive jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. The fundamental problem with Castro-Huertas implicit intent argument is that the text of the General Crimes Act says no such thing.  Congress expresses its intentions through statutory text passed by both Houses and signed by the President (or passed over a Presidential veto).  As this Court has repeatedly stated, the text of a law controls over purported legislative intentions unmoored from any statutory text.  The Court may not replace the actual text with speculation as to Congress intent.  Magwood v. Patterson,\\n\\n561 U.S. 320, 334 (2010).  Rather, the Court will presume more modestly that the legislature says what it means and means what it says.  Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc.,\\n\\n582 U.S. 79, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see, e.g., McGirt, 591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) ([W]ishes are not laws); Virginia Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 587 U.S. ___, ___ (2019) (lead opinion) (slip op., at 14) (The Supremacy Clause cannot be deployed to elevate abstract and unenacted legislative desires above state law); Alexander v. Sandoval,\\n\\n532 U.S. 275, 287288 (2001) (The Court does not give dispositive weight to the expectations that the enacting Congress had formed in light of the contemporary legal context, because we begin (and find that we can end) our search for Congresss intent with ... text and structure (internal quotation marks omitted)); Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.,\\n\\n511 U.S. 164, 173 (1994) ([T]he text of the statute controls our decision). To buttress his implicit intent argument, Castro-Huerta seizes on the history of the General Crimes Act.  At the time of the Acts earliest iterations in 1817 and 1834, Indian country was separate from the States.  Therefore, at that time, state law did not apply in Indian countryin the same way that New York law would not ordinarily have applied in New Jersey.  But territorial separationnot jurisdictional preemption by the General Crimes Actwas the reason that state authority did not extend to Indian country at that time. Because Congress operated under a different territorial paradigm in 1817 and 1834, it had no reason at that time to consider whether to preempt preexisting or lawfully assumed state criminal authority in Indian country.  For present purposes, the fundamental point is that the text of the General Crimes Act does not preempt state law.  And this Court does not rewrite a constitutionally valid statutory text under the banner of speculation about what Congress might have done had it faced a question that ... it never faced.  Henson, 582 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  The history of territorial separation during the early years of the Republic is not a license or excuse to rewrite the text of the General Crimes Act. As noted above, the Worcester-era understanding of Indian country as separate from the State was abandoned later in the 1800s.  After that change, Indian country in each State became part of that States territory.  But Congress did not alter the General Crimes Act to make federal criminal jurisdiction exclusive in Indian country.  To this day, the text of the General Crimes Act still does not make federal jurisdiction exclusive or preempt state jurisdiction. In 1882, in McBratney, moreover, this Court held that States have jurisdiction to prosecute at least some crimes committed in Indian country.  Since 1882, therefore, Congress has been specifically aware that state criminal laws apply to some extent in Indian country.  Yet since then, Congress has never enacted new legislation that would render federal jurisdiction exclusive or preempt state jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians in Indian country.  Additionally, in 1979, the Office of Legal Counsel stated that this Court had not resolved the specific issue of state jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country, and that the issue was not settled.  3 Op. OLC 111, 117119 (1979).  Yet Congress still did not act to make federal jurisdiction exclusive or to preempt state jurisdiction. On a different tack, Castro-Huerta invokes the reenactment canon.  Castro-Huerta points out that, in 1948, Congress recodified the General Crimes Act.  Two years before that recodification, this Court suggested in dicta that States lack jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  See Williams v. United States,\\n\\n327 U.S. 711, 714 (1946).  Castro-Huerta contends that the 1948 Congress therefore intended to ratify the Williams dicta. Castro-Huertas reenactment-canon argument is misplaced.  First of all, the reenactment canon does not override clear statutory language of the kind present in the General Crimes Act.  See BP p.l.c. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 593 U.S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 11).  In addition, the canon does not apply to dicta.  See Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,\\n\\n543 U.S. 335, 349, 351, n. 12 (2005).  The Courts statements in Williams were pure dicta.  Indeed, the Williams dicta did not even purport to interpret the text of the General Crimes Act.  Dicta that does not analyze the relevant statutory provision cannot be said to have resolved the statutes meaning.  Moreover, any inference from Congresss 1948 recodification is especially weak because that recodification was not specific to the General Crimes Act, but instead was simply a general recodification of all federal criminal laws.  This Court has previously explained that the function of the 1948 recodification was generally limited to that of consolidation and codification.  Muniz v. Hoffman,\\n\\n422 U.S. 454, 474 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This Court does not infer that Congress, in revising and consolidating the laws, intended to change their policy, unless such an intention be clearly expressed.  Id., at 470 (internal quotation marks omitted). For many reasons, then, we cannot conclude that Congress, by recodifying the entire Federal Criminal Code in 1948, silently ratified a few sentences of dicta from Williams.  The reenactment canon does not apply in this case. Third, Castro-Huerta contends that the Court has repeated the 1946 Williams dicta on several subsequent occasions.  But the Courts dicta, even if repeated, does not constitute precedent and does not alter the plain text of the General Crimes Act, which was the law passed by Congress and signed by the President.  See National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Alston, 594 U.S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 21).[3] Moreover, there is a good explanation for why the Courts previous comments on this issue came only in the form of tangential dicta.  The question of whether States have concurrent jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country did not previously matter all that much and did not warrant this Courts review.  Through congressional grants of authority in Public Law 280 or state-specific statutes, some States with substantial Indian populations have long possessed broad jurisdiction to prosecute a vast array of crimes in Indian country (including crimes by Indians).  See Brief for National Congress of American Indians as Amicus Curiae 20, and n.2.  Indeed, Castro-Huerta notes that 21 States have jurisdiction over crimes by or against Indians in some Indian country.  Brief for Respondent 7.  So the General Crimes Act questionnamely, whether that Act preempts inherent state prosecutorial authority in Indian countrywas not relevant in those States. In any event, this Court never considered the General Crimes Act preemption question.  As the Office of Legal Counsel put it, many courts, without carefully considering the question, have assumed that Federal jurisdictio[n] whenever it obtains is exclusive.  We nevertheless believe that it is a matter that should not be regarded as settled before it has been fully explored by the courts.  3 Op. OLC, at 117.  This case is the first time that the matter has been fully explored by this Court. Until the Courts decision in McGirt two years ago, this question likewise did not matter much in Oklahoma.  Most everyone in Oklahoma previously understood that the State included almost no Indian country.  McGirt, 590 U.S., at ______ (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3132).  But after McGirt, about 43% of Oklahomaincluding Tulsais now considered Indian country.  Therefore, the question of whether the State of Oklahoma retains concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute non-Indian on Indian crimes in Indian country has suddenly assumed immense importance.  The jurisdictional question has now been called.  In light of the newfound significance of the question, it is necessary and appropriate for this Court to take its first hard look at the text and structure of the General Crimes Act, rather than relying on scattered dicta about a question that, until now, was relatively insignificant in the real world. After independently examining the question, we have concluded that the General Crimes Act does not preempt state jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. 2 Castro-Huerta next invokes Public Law 280 as a source of preemption.  That argument is similarly unpersuasive. Public Law 280 affirmatively grants certain States broad jurisdiction to prosecute state-law offenses committed by or against Indians in Indian country.  See\\n\\n18 U.S.C. 1162.  (Other States may opt in, with tribal consent.\\n\\n25 U.S.C. 1321.)  But Public Law 280 does not preempt any preexisting or otherwise lawfully assumed jurisdiction that States possess to prosecute crimes in Indian country.  Indeed, the Court has already concluded as much:  Nothing in the language or legislative history of Pub. L. 280 indicates that it was meant to divest States of pre-existing and otherwise lawfully assumed jurisdiction.  Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P.C., 467 U.S. 138, 150 (1984).  The Courts definitive statement in Three Affiliated Tribes about Public Law 280 applies to both civil and criminal jurisdiction.  And the Courts statement follows ineluctably from the statutory text:  Public Law 280 contains no language that preempts States civil or criminal jurisdiction. Castro-Huerta separately contends that the enactment of Public Law 280 in 1953 would have been pointless surplusage if States already had concurrent jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  So he says that, as of 1953, Congress must have assumed that States did not already have concurrent jurisdiction over those crimes.  To begin with, assumptions are not laws, and the fact remains that Public Law 280 contains no language preempting state jurisdiction, as the Court already held in Three Affiliated Tribes.  Apart from that, Public Law 280 encompasses far more than just non-Indian on Indian crimes (the issue here).  Public Law 280 also grants States jurisdiction over crimes committed by Indians.  See Conference of Western Attorneys General, American Indian Law Deskbook 4.6, p. 250251 (2021 ed.); cf. Negonsott, 507 U.S., at 105107.  Absent Public Law 280, state jurisdiction over those Indian-defendant crimes could implicate principles of tribal self-government.  See White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker,\\n\\n448 U.S. 136, 142143 (1980); Part IIIB, infra.  So our resolution of the narrow jurisdictional issue in this case does not negate the significance of Public Law 280 in affording States broad criminal jurisdiction over other crimes committed in Indian country, such as crimes committed by Indians.[4] In any event, to the extent that there is any overlap (or even complete overlap) between Public Law 280s jurisdictional grant and some of the States preexisting jurisdiction with respect to crimes committed in Indian country, it made good sense for Congress in 1953 to explicitly grant such authority in Public Law 280.  The scope of the States authority had not previously been resolved by this Court, except in cases such as McBratney and Draper with respect to non-Indian on non-Indian crimes.  Congressional action in the face of such legal uncertainty cannot reasonably be characterized as unnecessary surplusage.  See Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. ___, ______ (2019) (slip op., at 2021).  And finally, even if there is some surplusage, the Court has stated that [r]edundancy is not a silver bullet when interpreting statutes.  Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc., 586 U.S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 11). In sum, Public Law 280 does not preempt state authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. B Applying what has been referred to as the Bracker balancing test, this Court has recognized that even when federal law does not preempt state jurisdiction under ordinary preemption analysis, preemption may still occur if the exercise of state jurisdiction would unlawfully infringe upon tribal self-government.  See Bracker, 448 U.S., at 142143; see also New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe,\\n\\n462 U.S. 324, 333335 (1983).  Under the Bracker balancing test, the Court considers tribal interests, federal interests, and state interests.  448 U.S., at 145.[5] Here, Bracker does not bar the State from prosecuting crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. First, the exercise of state jurisdiction here would not infringe on tribal self-government.  In particular, a state prosecution of a crime committed by a non-Indian against an Indian would not deprive the tribe of any of its prosecutorial authority.  That is because, with exceptions not invoked here, Indian tribes lack criminal jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians such as Castro-Huerta, even when non-Indians commit crimes against Indians in Indian country.  See Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe,\\n\\n435 U.S. 191, 195 (1978). Moreover, a state prosecution of a non-Indian does not involve the exercise of state power over any Indian or over any tribe.  The only parties to the criminal case are the State and the non-Indian defendant.  Therefore, as has been recognized, any tribal self-government justification for preemption of state jurisdiction would be problematic.  American Indian Law Deskbook 4.8, at 260; see Three Affiliated Tribes, 467 U.S., at 148; see also Hicks, 533 U.S., at 364; McBratney, 104 U.S., at 623624; Draper, 164 U.S., at 242243.[6] Second, a state prosecution of a non-Indian likewise would not harm the federal interest in protecting Indian victims.  State prosecution would supplement federal authority, not supplant federal authority.  As the United States has explained in the past, recognition of concurrent state jurisdiction could facilitate effective law enforcement on the Reservation, and thereby further the federal and tribal interests in protecting Indians and their property against the actions of non-Indians.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Arizona v. Flint, O. T. 1988, No. 603, p.6.  The situation might be different if state jurisdiction ousted federal jurisdiction.  But because the States jurisdiction would be concurrent with federal jurisdiction, a state prosecution would not preclude an earlier or later federal prosecution and would not harm the federal interest in protecting Indian victims. Third, the State has a strong sovereign interest in ensuring public safety and criminal justice within its territory, and in protecting all crime victims.  See Dibble, 21 How., at 370.  The State also has a strong interest in ensuring that criminal offendersespecially violent offendersare appropriately punished and do not harm others in the State. The States interest in protecting crime victims includes both Indian and non-Indian victims.  If his victim were a non-Indian, Castro-Huerta could be prosecuted by the State, as he acknowledges.  But because his victim is an Indian, Castro-Huerta says that he is free from state prosecution.  Castro-Huertas argument would require this Court to treat Indian victims as second-class citizens.  We decline to do so.[7] IV The dissent emphasizes the history of mistreatment of American Indians.  But that history does not resolve the legal questions presented in this case.  Those questions are:  (i)whether Indian country is part of a State or instead is separate and independent from a State; and (ii)if Indian country is part of a State, whether the State has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Government to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. The answers to those questions are straightforward.  On the first question, as explained above, this Court has repeatedly ruled that Indian country is part of a State, not separate from a State.  By contrast, the dissent lifts up the 1832 decision in Worcester v. Georgia as a proper exposition of Indian law.  But this Court long ago made clear that Worcester rested on a mistaken understanding of the relationship between Indian country and the States.  The Court has stated that the general notion drawn from Chief Justice Marshalls opinion in Worcester v. Georgia has yielded to closer analysis:  By 1880 the Court no longer viewed reservations as distinct nations.  On the contrary, it was said that a reservation was in many cases a part of the surrounding State or Territory, and subject to its jurisdiction except as forbidden by federal law.  Organized Village of Kake, 369 U.S., at 72. Because Indian country is part of a State, not separate from a State, the second question herethe question regarding the States jurisdiction to prosecute Castro-Huertais also straightforward.  Under the Constitution, States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes within their territory except when preempted (in a manner consistent with the Constitution) by federal law or by principles of tribal self-government.  As we have explained, no federal law preempts the States exercise of jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  And principles of tribal self-government likewise do not preempt state jurisdiction here. As a corollary to its argument that Indian country is inherently separate from States, the dissent contends that Congress must affirmatively authorize States to exercise jurisdiction in Indian country, even jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians.  But under the Constitution and this Courts precedents, the default is that States may exercise criminal jurisdiction within their territory.  See Amdt. 10.  States do not need a permission slip from Congress to exercise their sovereign authority.  In other words, the default is that States have criminal jurisdiction in Indian country unless that jurisdiction is preempted.  In the dissents view, by contrast, the default is that States do not have criminal jurisdiction in Indian country unless Congress specifically provides it.  The dissents view is inconsistent with the Constitutions structure, the States inherent sovereignty, and the Courts precedents. Straying further afield, the dissent seizes on treaties from the 1800s.  Post, at 1820, and n.4 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).[8]  But those treaties do not preclude state jurisdiction here.  The dissent relies heavily on the 1835 Treaty of New Echota, which stated that Indian country was separate from States, and which the dissent says was preserved in relevant part by the 1866 Treaty.  See Treaty with the Cherokee (New Echota), Art. 5, Dec. 29, 1835,\\n\\n7Stat.\\n481; Treaty with the Cherokee, July 19, 1866,\\n\\n14Stat.\\n709.  But history and legal development did not end in 1866.  Some early treaties may have been consistent with the Worcester-era theory of separateness.  But as relevant here, those treaties have been supplanted:  Specific to Oklahoma, those treaties, in relevant part, were formally supplanted no later than the 1906 Act enabling Oklahomas statehood.  See Oklahoma Enabling Act, ch.3335,\\n\\n34Stat.\\n267.  As this Court has previously concluded, admission of a State into the Union necessarily repeals the provisions of any prior statute, or of any existing treaty that is inconsistent with the States exercise of criminal jurisdiction throughout the whole of the territory within its limits, including Indian country, unless the enabling act says otherwise by express words.  McBratney, 104 U.S., at 623624; see Draper, 164 U.S., at 242246.  The Oklahoma Enabling Act contains no such express exception.  Therefore, at least since Oklahomas statehood in the early 1900s, Indian country has been part of the territory of Oklahoma. The dissent responds that the language of the 1906 statute enabling Oklahomas statehood itself established a jurisdictional division between the State and Indian country.  See post, at 2022 (discussing the Oklahoma Enabling Act).  That argument is mistaken.  This Court long ago explained that interpreting a statehood act to divest a State of jurisdiction over Indian country wholly situated within [its] geographical boundaries would undermine the very nature of the equality conferred on the State by virtue of its admission into the Union.  Draper, 164 U.S., at 242243.  So the Court requires clear statutory language to create an exception to that rule.  Id., at 244.  To reiterate, the Oklahoma Enabling Act contains no such clear language.  Indeed, the Court has interpreted similar statutory language in other state enabling acts not to displace state jurisdiction.  See id., at 243247; Organized Village of Kake, 369 U.S., at 6771.  In Organized Village of Kake, the Court specifically addressed several state enabling acts, including the Oklahoma Enabling Act, and stated that statutory language reserving jurisdiction and control to the United States was meant to preserve federal jurisdiction to the extent that it existed before statehood, not to make federal jurisdiction exclusive.  Id., at 6770.  Consistent with that precedent, todays decision recognizes that the Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.[9] The dissent incorrectly seeks to characterize various aspects of the Courts decision as dicta.  To be clear, the Court today holds that Indian country within a States territory is part of a State, not separate from a State.  Therefore, a State has jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in Indian country unless state jurisdiction is preempted.  With respect to crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country, the Court today further holds that the General Crimes Act does not preempt the States authority to prosecute; that Public Law 280 does not preempt the States authority to prosecute; that no principle of tribal self-government preempts the States authority to prosecute; that the cited treaties do not preempt Oklahomas authority to prosecute; and that the Oklahoma Enabling Act does not preempt Oklahomas authority to prosecute (indeed, it solidifies the States presumptive sovereign authority to prosecute).  Comments in the dissenting opinion suggesting anything otherwise are just that: comments in a dissenting opinion.  Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz,\\n\\n449 U.S. 166, 177, n. 10 (1980). From start to finish, the dissent employs extraordinary rhetoric in articulating its deeply held policy views about what Indian law should be.  The dissent goes so far as to draft a proposed statute for Congress.  But this Courts proper role under Article III of the Constitution is to declare what the law is, not what we think the law should be.  The dissents views about the jurisdictional question presented in this case are contrary to this Courts precedents and to the laws enacted by Congress. *** We conclude that the Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered. &&& SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21429 _________________ OKLAHOMA, PETITIONER v. VICTOR MANUEL CASTRO-HUERTA on writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of oklahoma [June 29, 2022]  Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting. In 1831, Georgia arrested Samuel Worcester, a white missionary, for preaching to the Cherokee on tribal lands without a license.  Really, the prosecution was a show of forcean attempt by the State to demonstrate its authority over tribal lands.  Speaking for this Court, Chief Justice Marshall refused to endorse Georgias ploy because the State enjoyed no lawful right to govern the territory of a separate sovereign.  See Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 561 (1832).  The Courts decision was deeply unpopular, and both Georgia and President Jackson flouted it.  But in time, Worcester came to be recognized as one of this Courts finer hours.  The decision established a foundational rule that would persist for over 200 years:  Native American Tribes retain their sovereignty unless and until Congress ordains otherwise.  Worcester proved that, even in the [c]ourts of the conqueror, the rule of law meant something.  Johnsons Lessee v. McIntosh, 8 Wheat. 543, 588 (1823). Where this Court once stood firm, today it wilts.  After the Cherokees exile to what became Oklahoma, the federal government promised the Tribe that it would remain forever free from interference by state authorities.  Only the Tribe or the federal government could punish crimes by or against tribal members on tribal lands.  At various points in its history, Oklahoma has chafed at this limitation.  Now, the State seeks to claim for itself the power to try crimes by non-Indians against tribal members within the Cherokee Reservation.  Where our predecessors refused to participate in one States unlawful power grab at the expense of the Cherokee, todays Court accedes to anothers.  Respectfully, I dissent. I A Long before our Republic, the Cherokee controlled much of what is now Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.  See 1 G. Litton, History of Oklahoma at the Golden Anniversary of Statehood 91 (1957) (Litton).  The Cherokee were a distinct, independent political communit[y], who retain[ed] their original sovereign right to regulat[e] their internal and social relations.  Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez,\\n\\n436 U.S. 49, 55 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted). As colonists settled coastal areas near Cherokee territory, the Tribe proved a valuable trading partnerand a military threat.  See W. Echo-Hawk, In the Court of the Conqueror 89 (2010).  Recognizing this, Great Britain signed a treaty with the Cherokee in 1730.  See 1 Litton 92.  As was true of tributary and feudatory states in Europe, the Cherokee did not cease to be sovereign and independent under this arrangement, but retained the right to govern their internal affairs.  E.de Vattel, Law of Nations 6061 (1805); see Worcester, 6 Pet., at 561.  Meanwhile, under British law the crown possessed centraliz[ed] authority over diplomacy with Tribes to the exclusion of colonial governments.  See C.Berkey, United StatesIndian Relations: The Constitutional Basis, in Exiled in the Land of the Free 192 (H. Lyons ed. 1992). Ultimately, the American Revolution replaced that legal framework with a similar one.  When the delegates drafted the Articles of Confederation, they debated whether the national or state authorities should manage Indian affairs.  See 6 Journals of the Continental Congress, 17741789, pp. 10771079 (W. Ford ed. 1906).  The resulting compromise proved unworkable.  The Articles granted Congress the sole and exclusive right and power of ... regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians.  Art. IX.  But the Articles undermined that assignment by further providing that the legislative right of any state[,] within its own limits, could not be infringed or violated.  Ibid.  Together, these provisions led to battles between national and state governments over who could oversee relations with various Tribes.  See G. Ablavsky, Beyond the Indian Commerce Clause, 124 Yale L.J. 1012, 10331035 (2015) (Ablavsky).  James Madison later complained that the Articles division of authority over Indian affairs had endeavored to accomplish [an] impossibilit[y]; to reconcile a partial sovereignty in the Union, with complete sovereignty in the States.  The Federalist No. 42, p. 269 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). When the framers convened to draft a new Constitution, this problem was among those they sought to resolve.  To that end, they gave the federal government broad general powers over Indian affairs.  United States v. Lara,\\n\\n541 U.S. 193, 200 (2004).  The Constitution afforded Congress authority to make war and negotiate treaties with the Tribes.  See Art. I,  8; Art. VI, cl.2.  It barred States from doing either of these things.  See Art. I, 10.  And the Constitution granted Congress the power to regulate Commerce ... with the Indian Tribes.  Art. I, 8, cl. 3.  Nor did the Constitution replicate the Articles carveout for state power over Tribes within their borders.  Madison praised this change, contending that the new federal government would be very properly unfettered from this prior limitatio[n].  The Federalist No. 42, at 268.  Antifederalist Abraham Yates agreed (but bemoaned) that the Constitution totally surrender[ed] into the hands of Congress the management and regulation of the Indian affairs.  Letter to the Citizens of the State of New York (June 1314, 1788), in 20 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution 1153, 1158 (J. Kaminski et al. eds. 2004). Consistent with that view, the Washington Administration insisted that the federal government enjoyed exclusive constitutional authority over tribal relations.  Ablavsky 1019.  The new Administration understood, too, that Tribes remained otherwise free to govern their internal affairs without state interference.  See id., at 10411042, 10651067.  In a letter to the Governor of Pennsylvania, President Washington stated curtly that the United States ... posses[es] the only authority of regulating an intercourse with [the Indians], and redressing their grievances.  Letter to T. Mifflin (Sept. 4, 1790), in 6 Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 396 (D. Twohig ed. 1996).  Even Thomas Jefferson, the great defender of the States powers, agreed that under the present Constitution no State [has] a right to Treat with the Indians without the consent of the General Government.  Letter to H. Knox (Aug. 10, 1791), in 22 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 27 (C. Cullen, E. Sheridan, & R Lester eds. 1986). Nor was this view confined to the Executive Branch.  Congress quickly exercised its new constitutional authority.  In 1790, it enacted the first Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, which pervasively regulated commercial and social exchanges among Indians and non-Indians.  Ch. 33,\\n\\n1Stat.\\n137.  Congress also provided for federal jurisdiction over crimes by non-Indians against Indians on tribal lands.  56, id., at 138.  States, too, recognized their lack of authority.  See Ablavsky 1019, 1043.  In 1789, South Carolina Governor Charles Pinckney acknowledged to Washington that the sole management of India[n] affairs is now committed to the general Government.  Letter to G. Washington (Dec. 14), in 4 Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 401, 404 (D. Twohig ed. 1993).  Initially, even Georgia took the same view.  See Letter from Georgia House of Representatives to Governor Edward Telfair (June 10, 1790), in 3 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution: Delaware, New Jersey, Georgia, and Connecticut 178 (M. Jensen ed. 1978) (Microform Supp. Doc. No. 50). It was against this background that Chief Justice Marshall faced Worcester.  After gold was discovered in Cherokee territory in the 1820s, Georgias Legislature enacted laws designed to seize [the] whole Cherokee country, parcel it out among the neighboring counties of the state ... abolish [the Tribes] institutions and its laws, and annihilate its political existence.  Worcester, 6 Pet., at 542.  Like Oklahoma today, Georgia also purported to extend its criminal laws to Cherokee lands.  See ibid.; see also S. Breyer, The Cherokee Indians and the Supreme Court, 87 The Georgia Historical Q. 408, 416418 (2003) (Breyer).  In refusing to sanction Georgias power grab, this Court explained that the States assertion of jurisdiction over the Cherokee nation was void, because under our Constitution only the federal government possessed the power to manage relations with the Tribe.  Worcester, 6 Pet., at 542, 561562. B  Two years later, and exercising its authority to regulate tribal affairs in the shadow of Worcester, Congress adopted the General Crimes Act of 1834 (GCA).  That law extended federal criminal jurisdiction to tribal lands for certain crimes and, in doing so, served two apparent purposes.  First, as a courtesy to the Tribes, the law represented a promise by the federal government to punish crimes ... committed ... by and against our own [non-Indian] citizens. H.Rep. No. 474, 23d Cong., 1st Sess., 13 (1834) (H. Rep. No. 474).  That jurisdictional arrangement was also consistent with, and even seemingly compelled by, the federal governments treaties with various Tribes.  See F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 731 (N. Newton etal. eds. 2005) (Cohen); R. Clinton, Development of Criminal Jurisdiction Over Indian Lands: The Historical Perspective, 17 Ariz. L.Rev. 951, 958962 (1975) (Clinton).  Second, because Worcester held that States lacked criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands, Congress sought to ensure a federal forum for crimes committed by and against non-Indians.  See H. Rep. No. 474, at 13.  Otherwise, Congress understood, non-Indian settlers would be subject to tribal jurisdiction alone.  See id., at 13, 18; R.Barsh & J. Henderson, The Betrayal, Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe and the Hunting of the Snark, 63 Minn. L. Rev. 609, 625626 (1979).  Congress reenacted the GCA in 1948 with minor amendments, but it remains in force today more or less in its original form.  See 18 U.S.C. 1152 (1946 ed., Supp. II). Shortly after it adopted the GCA, the Senate ratified the Treaty of New Echota with the Cherokee in 1836.  After the Tribes removal from Georgia, the United States promised the Cherokee that they would enjoy a new home in the West where they could establish ... a government of their choice.  Treaty with the Cherokee, Preamble, Dec. 29, 1835,\\n\\n7Stat.\\n478.  Acknowledging the Tribes past difficulties ... under the jurisdiction and laws of the State Governments, the treaty also pledged that the Tribe would remain forever free from State sovereignties.  Ibid.; see Art. 5, id., at 481.  These promises constituted an indemnity, guaranteed by the faith of the nation, that [t]he United States and the Indian tribes [would be] the sole parties with power on new western reservations like the Cherokees.  H.Rep. No. 474, at 18 (emphasis in original). Over time, Congress revised some of these arrangements.  In 1885, dissatisfied with how the Sioux Tribe responded to the murder of a tribal member, Congress adopted the Major Crimes Act (MCA).  See R. Anderson, S. Krakoff, & B. Berger, American Indian Law: Cases and Commentary 9096 (4th ed. 2008) (Anderson).  There, Congress directed that, moving forward, only the federal government, not the Tribes, could prosecute certain serious offenses by tribal members on tribal lands.  See 18 U.S.C. 1153(a).  On its own initiative, this Court then went a step further.  Relying on language in certain laws admitting specific States to the Union, the Court held that States were now entitled to prosecute crimes by non-Indians against non-Indians on tribal lands.  See United States v. McBratney,\\n\\n104 U.S. 621, 623 (1882); Draper v. United States,\\n\\n164 U.S. 240, 243, 247 (1896).  Through all these developments, however, at least one promise remained:  States could play no role in the prosecution of crimes by or against Native Americans on tribal lands.  See Williams v. Lee,\\n\\n358 U.S. 217, 220 (1959). In 1906, Congress reaffirmed this promise to the Cherokee in Oklahoma.  As a condition of its admission to the Union, Congress required Oklahoma to declare that [it] forever disclaim[s] all right and title in or to ... all lands lying within [the States] limits owned or held by any Indian, tribe, or nation.\\n\\n34Stat.\\n270.  Instead, Congress provided that tribal lands would remain subject to the jurisdiction, disposal, and control of the United States.  Ibid.  As if the point wasnt clear enough, Congress further provided that nothing contained in the [new Oklahoma state] constitution shall be construed to ... limit or affect the authority of the Government of the United States ... respecting [the States] Indians ... which it would have been competent to make if this Act had never been passed.  Id., at 267268.  The following year, Oklahoma adopted a State Constitution consistent with Congresss instructions.  Art. I,  3; see also Clinton 961. In the years that followed, certain States sought arrangements different from Oklahomas.  And once more, Congress intervened.  In 1940, Kansas asked for and received permission from Congress to exercise jurisdiction over crimes by or against Indians on tribal lands.  18 U.S.C. 3243.  Through the rest of the decade, Congress experimented with similar laws for New York, Iowa, and North Dakota.[1]  Then, in 1953, Congress adopted Public Law 280.  That statute granted five additional States criminal jurisdiction over offenses ... by or against Indians and established procedures by which further States could secure the same authority.  See ch. 505,  2,\\n\\n67Stat.\\n588.  Ultimately, however, some of these arrangements proved unpopular.  Not only with affected Tribes.  See C. Goldberg-Ambrose, Public Law 280 and the Problem of Lawlessness in California Indian Country, 44 UCLA L. Rev. 1405, 14061407 (1997) (Goldberg-Ambrose).  These arrangements also proved unpopular with certain States that viewed their new law enforcement responsibilities on tribal lands as unfunded federal mandates.  See Anderson 436.  A few States even renounced their Public Law 280 jurisdiction.  See Cohen 579. By 1968, the federal government came to conclude that, as a matter of justice and as a matter of enlightened social policy, the time ha[d] come to break decisively with the past and to create the conditions for a new era in which the Indian future is determined by Indian acts and Indian decisions.  Richard M. Nixon, Special Message on Indian Affairs (July 8, 1970).  Consistent with that vision, Congress amended Public Law 280 to require tribal consent before any State could assume jurisdiction over crimes by or against Indians on tribal lands.  Act of Apr. 11, 1968,  401,\\n\\n82Stat.\\n78, 406, id., at 80 (25 U.S.C.  1321(a), 1326).  Recognizing that certain States enabling acts barred state authority on tribal lands and required States to adopt constitutional provisions guaranteeing as much, Congress also authorized States to amend, where necessary, their State constitution or ... statutes.  404,\\n\\n82Stat.\\n79 (25 U.S.C. 1324).  In doing so, however, Congress emphasized that affected States could not assume jurisdiction to prosecute offenses by or against tribal members on tribal lands until they appropriately amended their State constitution or statutes.  Ibid.  To date, Oklahoma has not amended its state constitutional provisions disclaiming jurisdiction over tribal lands.  Nor has Oklahoma sought or obtained tribal consent to the exercise of its jurisdiction.  See The Honorable E. Kelly Haney, 22 Okla. Op. Atty. Gen. No.  9032, 72, 1991 WL 567868, *1 (Mar. 1, 1991) (Haney).  Thus, Oklahoma has remained, in Congresss words, a State not having jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed by or against Indians in the areas of Indian country situated within its borders.  25 U.S.C. 1321(a). C Rather than seek tribal consent pursuant to Public Law 280 or persuade Congress to adopt a state-specific statute authorizing it to prosecute crimes by or against tribal members on tribal lands, Oklahoma has chosen a different path.  In the decades following statehood, many settlers engaged in schemes to seize Indian lands and mineral rights by subterfuge.  See A.Debo, And Still the Waters Run 92125 (1940) (Debo).  These schemes resulted in the bulk of the landed wealth of the Indians ending up in the hands of the new settlers.  See ibid.; see also id., at 181202.  State officials and courts were sometimes complicit in the process.  See id., at 182183, 185, 195196.  For years, too, Oklahoma courts asserted the power to hear criminal cases involving Native Americans on lands allotted to and owned by tribal members despite the contrary commands of the Oklahoma Enabling Act and the States own constitution.  The State only disavowed that practice in 1991, after defeats in state and federal court.  See Haney, 1991 WL 567868, *1*3; see also State v. Klindt, 782 P.2d 401, 404 (Okla. Crim. App. 1989); Ross v. Neff, 905 F.2d 1349, 1353 (CA10 1990). Still, it seems old habits die slowly.  Even after renouncing the power to try criminal cases involving Native Americans on allotted tribal lands, Oklahoma continued to claim the power to prosecute crimes by or against Native Americans within tribal reservations.  The State did so on the theory that at some (unspecified) point in the past, Congress had disestablished those reservations.  In McGirt v. Oklahoma, this Court rejected that argument in a case involving the Muscogee (Creek) Tribe.  591 U.S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 1).  We explained that Congress had never disestablished the Creek Reservation.  Nor were we willing to usurp Congresss authority and disestablish that reservation by a lawless act of judicial fiat.  See id., at ___ (slip op., at 42).  Accordingly, only federal and tribal authorities were lawfully entitled to try crimes by or against Native Americans within the Tribes reservation.  Ibid.  Following McGirt, Oklahomas courts recognized that what held true for the Creek also held true for the Cherokee:  Congress had never disestablished its reservation and, accordingly, the State lacked authority to try offenses by or against tribal members within the Cherokee Reservation.  See Spears v. State, 2021 OK CR 7,  1014, 485 P.3d 873, 876877. Once more, Oklahoma could have responded to this development by asking Congress for state-specific legislation authorizing it to exercise criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands, as Kansas and various other States have done.  The State could have employed the procedures of Public Law 280 to amend its own laws and obtain tribal consent.  Instead, Oklahoma responded with a media and litigation campaign seeking to portray reservations within its Statewhere federal and tribal authorities may prosecute crimes by and against tribal members and Oklahoma can pursue cases involving only non-Indiansas lawless dystopias.  See Brief for Cherokee Nation etal. as Amici Curiae 18 (Cherokee Brief) (The States tale of a criminal dystopia in eastern Oklahoma is just that: A tale). That effort culminated in this case.  In it, Oklahoma has pursued alternative lines of argument.  First, the State has asked this Court to revisit McGirt and unilaterally eliminate all reservations in Oklahoma.  Second, the State has argued that it enjoys a previously unrecognized inherent authority to try crimes within reservation boundaries by non-Indians against tribal membersa claim Oklahomas own courts have rejected.  See Bosse v. State, 2021 OK CR 3, 484 P.3d 286, 294295. Ultimately, this Court declined to entertain the States first argument but agreed to review the second.  Nominally, the question comes to us in a case involving Victor Castro-Huerta, a non-Indian who abused his Cherokee stepdaughter within the Tribes reservation.  Initially, a state court convicted him for a state crime.  After McGirt, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals determined that his conviction was invalid because only federal and tribal officials possess authority to prosecute crimes by or against Native Americans on the Cherokee Reservation.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a.  The federal government swiftly reindicted Mr. Castro-Huerta, and a federal court again found him guilty.  Now before us, Oklahoma seeks to undo Mr. Castro-Huertas federal conviction and have him transferred from federal prison to a state facility to resume his state sentence. Really, though, this case has less to do with where Mr. Castro-Huerta serves his time and much more to do with Oklahomas effort to gain a legal foothold for its wish to exercise jurisdiction over crimes involving tribal members on tribal lands.  To succeed, Oklahoma must disavow adverse rulings from its own courts; disregard its 1991 recognition that it lacks legal authority to try cases of this sort; and ignore fundamental principles of tribal sovereignty, a treaty, the Oklahoma Enabling Act, its own state constitution, and Public Law 280.  Oklahoma must pursue a proposition so novel and so unlikely that in over two centuries not a single State has successfully attempted it in this Court.  Incredibly, too, the defense of tribal interests against the States gambit falls to a non-Indian criminal defendant.  The real party in interest here isnt Mr. Castro-Huerta but the Cherokee, a Tribe of 400,000 members with its own government.  Yet the Cherokee have no voice as parties in these proceedings; they and other Tribes are relegated to the filing of amicus briefs. II A Today the Court rules for Oklahoma. In doing so, the Court announces that, when it comes to crimes by non-Indians against tribal members within tribal reservations, Oklahoma may exercise jurisdiction.  Ante, at 4.  But this declaration comes as if by oracle, without any sense of the history recounted above and unattached to any colorable legal authority.  Truly, a more ahistorical and mistaken statement of Indian law would be hard to fathom. The source of the Courts error is foundational.  Through most of its opinion, the Court proceeds on the premise that Oklahoma possesses inherent sovereign power to prosecute crimes on tribal reservations until and unless Congress preempt[s] that authority.  Ante, at 518.  The Court emphasizes that States normally wield broad police powers within their borders absent some preemptive federal law.  See ante, at 46; see also Virginia Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 587 U.S. ___, ___ (2019) (lead opinion) (slip op., at 12). But the effort to wedge Tribes into that paradigm is a category error.  Tribes are not private organizations within state boundaries.  Their reservations are not glorified private campgrounds.  Tribes are sovereigns.  And the preemption rule applicable to them is exactly the opposite of the normal rule.  Tribal sovereignty means that the criminal laws of the States can have no force on tribal members within tribal bounds unless and until Congress clearly ordains otherwise.  Worcester, 6 Pet., at 561.  After all, the power to punish crimes by or against ones own citizens within ones own territory to the exclusion of other authorities is and has always been among the most essential attributes of sovereignty.  See, e.g., Wilson v. Girard,\\n\\n354 U.S. 524, 529 (1957) (percuriam) (A sovereign nation has exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders); see also Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, 136 (1812); E. de Vattel, Law of Nations 8182 (1835 ed.). Nor is this notion, ante, at 5, some discarded artifact of a bygone era.  To be sure, Washington, Jefferson, Marshall, and so many others at the Nations founding appreciated the sovereign status of Native American Tribes.  See Part IA, supra.  But this Courts own cases have consistently reaffirmed the point.  Just weeks ago, the Court held that federal prosecutors did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause based on the essential premise that tribal criminal law is the product of a separate sovereig[n] exercising its own retained sovereignty.  Denezpi v. United States, 596 U.S. ___, ___ (2022) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Recently, too, this Court confirmed that Tribes enjoy sovereign immunity from suit.  See Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community,\\n\\n572 U.S. 782, 788789 (2014).   Throughout our history, the basic policy of Worcester that Tribes are separate sovereigns has remained.  Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S., at 219.[2] Because Tribes are sovereigns, this Court has consistently recognized that the usual standards of pre-emption are unhelpful.  White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker,\\n\\n448 U.S. 136, 143 (1980); see also Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico,\\n\\n490 U.S. 163, 176 (1989); Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation,\\n\\n425 U.S. 463, 475476 (1976); McClanahan v. Arizona Tax Commn,\\n\\n411 U.S. 164, 170172 (1973).  In typical preemption cases, courts start with the assumption that Congress has not displaced state authority.  Rice v. SantaFe Elevator Corp.,\\n\\n331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947).  But when a State tries to regulate tribal affairs, the same backdrop does not apply because Tribes have a claim to sovereignty [that] long predates that of our own Government.  McClanahan, 411 U.S., at 172; see also Bracker, 448 U.S., at 143.  So instead of searching for an Act of Congress displacing state authority, our cases require a search for federal legislation conferring state authority:  [U]nless and until Congress acts, the tribes retain their historic sovereign authority.  Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S., at 788 (internal quotation marks omitted); see United States v. Cooley, 593 U.S. ___, ______ (2021) (slip op., at 34) (instructing courts to ask if a treaty or statute has explicitly divested Indian tribes of the ... authority at issue); Anderson 317.  What is more, courts must tread lightly before concluding Congress has abrogated tribal sovereignty in favor of state authority.  Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S., at 60.  Any ambiguities in   Congresss work must be resolved in favor of tribal sovereignty and against state power.  See ibid.; see also Cotton Petroleum, 490 U.S., at 177.  And, if anything, these rules bear special force in the criminal context, which lies at the heart of tribal sovereignty and in which Congress has provided a nearly comprehensive set of statutes allocating criminal jurisdiction among federal, tribal, and state authorities.  Cohen 527.[3] B From 1834 to 1968, Congress adopted a series of laws governing criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands.  Those laws are many, detailed, and clear.  Each operates against the backdrop understanding that Tribes are sovereign and that in our constitutional order only Congress may displace their authority.  Nor does anything in Congresss work begin to confer on Oklahoma the authority it seeks. 1 Start with the GCA, first adopted by Congress in 1834 and most recently reenacted in 1948.  The GCA provides: Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, except the District of Columbia, shall extend to Indian Country.  This section shall not extend to offenses committed by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian, nor to any Indian committing any offense in the Indian country who has been punished by the local law of the tribe, or to any case where, by treaty stipulations, the exclusive jurisdiction over such offenses is or may be secured to the Indian tribes respectively. 18 U.S.C. 1152. As recounted above, Congress adopted the GCA in the aftermath of Worcesters holding that the federal government alone may regulate tribal affairs and States do not possess inherent authority to apply their criminal laws on tribal lands.  Responding to that decision, Congress did not choose to exercise its authority to allow state jurisdiction on tribal lands.  Far from it.  Congress chose only to extend federal law to tribal landsand even then only for certain crimes involving non-Indian settlers.  Otherwise, Congress recognized, those settlers might be subject to tribal criminal jurisdiction alone.  See Part IB, supra.  Several features of the law confirm this understanding.  Take just three. First, the GCA compares Indian country to place[s] within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.   1152.  The latter category refers to federal enclaves like national parks and military bases that the Constitution places under exclusive federal control.  See Art. I, 8, cl. 17; United States v. Cowboy, 694 F.2d 1228, 1234 (CA10 1982); see also Exparte Crow Dog,\\n\\n109 U.S. 556, 567 (1883).  And state laws generally do not apply in federal enclaves.  See, e.g., Fort Leavenworth R.Co. v. Lowe,\\n\\n114 U.S. 525, 532533 (1885).  Rather than unambiguously endow States with any sort of prosecutorial authority on tribal lands, the GCA thus makes plain that tribal lands are to be treated like federal enclaves subject to federal, not state, control. Second, the GCA provides that the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses shall apply on tribal lands.   1152.  Again, nothing here purports to extend state criminal laws to tribal lands.  Quite the contrary.  It would hardly make sense to apply federal general criminal lawto address all crimes ranging from murder to jaywalkingif state general criminal law already did the job.  Traditionally, this Court does not assume multiple sets of [general] criminal laws apply to those subject to federal protection.  Lewis v. United States,\\n\\n523 U.S. 155, 163 (1998).  Instead, when Congress converts an area into a federal enclave, we usually presume later-enacted state law does not apply.  Parker Drilling Management Services, Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at9). Third, after applying the federal governments general criminal laws to tribal lands, the GCA carves out some exceptions.  It provides that federal law shall not extend to crimes involving only Indians, crimes by Indians where the perpetrator has been punished by the local law of the tribe, or where a treaty grants a Tribe exclusive jurisdiction.   1152.  These exceptions ensure that the federal government does not meddle in cases most likely to implicate tribal sovereignty.  And it defies the imagination to think Congress would have taken such care to limit federal authority over these most sensitive cases while (somewhere, somehow) leaving States, so often the Tribes deadliest enemies, to enjoy free rein.  United States v. Kagama,\\n\\n118 U.S. 375, 384 (1886). 2 When Congress enacted the MCA in 1885, it proceeded once more against the backdrop rule that only tribal criminal law applies on tribal lands, that States enjoy no inherent authority to prosecute cases on tribal lands, and that only Congress may displace tribal power.  Nor, once more, did Congresss new legislation purport to allow States to prosecute crimes on tribal lands.  In response to concerns with how tribal authorities were handling major crimes committed by tribal members, in the MCA Congress took a step beyond the GCA and instructed that, in the future, the federal government would have exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute certain crimes by Indian defendants on tribal lands.  18 U.S.C. 1153(a); see also Part IB, supra.  Here again, Congresss work hardly would have been necessary or made sense if States already possessed jurisdiction to try crimes by or against Indians on tribal reservations.  Plainly, Congresss purpose in adopting the MCA was to answer the objection that major crimes by tribal members on tribal lands would otherwise be subject to prosecution by tribal authorities alone.  See Kagama, 118 U.S., at 383385. 3 Consider next the Treaty of New Echota and the Oklahoma Enabling Act.  In 1835, the United States entered into a treaty with the Cherokee.  In that treaty, the Nation promised that, within a new reservation in what was to become Oklahoma, the Tribe would enjoy the right to govern itself and remain forever free from State sovereignties and the jurisdiction of any State.  Treaty with the Cherokee, Preamble,\\n\\n7Stat.\\n478.  This Court has instructed that tribal treaties must be interpreted as they would naturally be understood by the Indians at ratification.  Herrera v. Wyoming, 587 U.S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 19) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And having just lost their traditional homelands to Georgia, who can doubt that the Cherokee understood this promise as a guarantee that they would retain their sovereign authority over crimes by or against tribal members subject only to federal, not state, law?  That was certainly the contemporaneous understanding of the House Committee on Indian Affairs, which observed that [t]he United States and the Indian tribes [would be] the sole parties with power over new reservations in the West.  H. Rep. No. 474, at 18; see also Part IB, supra.  This Court has long shared the same view.  By treaties and statutes, the Court has said, the right of the Cherokee [N]ation to exist as an autonomous body, subject always to the paramount authority of the United States, has been recognized.  Talton v. Mayes,\\n\\n163 U.S. 376, 379380 (1896).[4] In 1906, Congress sought to deliver on its treaty promises when it adopted the Oklahoma Enabling Act.  That law paved the way for the new States admission to the Union.  But in doing so, Congress took care to require Oklahoma to agree and declare that it would forever disclaim all right and title in or to ... all lands lying within [the States] limits owned or held by any Indian, tribe, or nation.\\n\\n34Stat.\\n270.  Instead of granting the State some new power to prosecute crimes by or against tribal members, Congress insisted that tribal lands shall be and remain subject to the jurisdiction, disposal, and control of the United States.  Ibid.  Oklahoma complied with Congresss instructions by adopting both of these commitments verbatim in its Constitution.  Art. I,  3. Underscoring the nature of this arrangement, the Enabling Act further provided that nothing contained in the [Oklahoma] constitution shall be construed ... to limit or affect the authority of the Government of the United States to make any law or regulation respecting such Indians, their lands, property, or other rights by treaties, agreement, law, or otherwise, which it would have been competent to make if this Act had never been passed.\\n\\n34Stat.\\n267268 (emphasis added).  Prior to statehood, too, no one could have questioned Congresss exclusive authority to regulate tribal lands and affairs in the Oklahoma territory.  See, e.g., U.S. Const., Art.IV; Kagama, 118 U.S., at 380 (citing federal governments exclusive sovereignty over federal territories); Simms v. Simms,\\n\\n175 U.S. 162, 168 (1899) (In the Territories of the United States, Congress has the entire dominion and sovereignty, ... Federal and state); Harjo v. Kleppe, 420 F. Supp. 1110, 1121 (DC 1976) (federal courts had pre-statehood jurisdiction); Clinton 960962.  The Oklahoma Enabling Act and the commitments it demanded in the new Oklahoma Constitution sought to maintain this status quo. Recognizing the point, this Court has explained that, [i]n passing the enabling act for the admission of the State of Oklahoma ... Congress was careful to preserve the authority of the Government of the United States over the Indians, their lands and property, which it had prior to the passage of the act.  Tiger v. Western Investment Co.,\\n\\n221 U.S. 286, 309 (1911) (emphasis added).  This Court has explained, too, that the grant of statehood to Oklahoma did nothing to disturb the long-settled rule that the guardianship of the United States over Native American Tribes in Oklahoma has not been abandoned.  United States v. Ramsey,\\n\\n271 U.S. 467, 469 (1926).  Instead, this Court has acknowledged, the federal governments authority in respect of crimes committed by or against Indians continued after the admission of the state as it was before.  Ibid.  In fact, the Court has long interpreted nearly identical language in the Arizona Enabling Actenacted close in time to its Oklahoma counterpartas reinforcing the traditional rule that the States lac[k] jurisdiction on tribal lands over crimes by or against Native Americans.  McClanahan, 411 U.S., at 175; see also Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Commn,\\n\\n380 U.S. 685, 687, n. 3 (1965).[5] 4 The few occasions on which Congress has even arguably authorized the application of state criminal law on tribal reservations still do not come anywhere near granting Oklahoma the power it seeks.  In the late 1800s, this Court in McBratney and Draper held that federal statutes admitting certain States to the Union effectively meant those States could now prosecute crimes on tribal lands involving only non-Indians.  Yet, as aggressive as these decisions were, they took care to safeguard the rule that a States admission to the Union does not convey with it the power to punish crimes committed by or against Indians.  McBratney, 104 U.S., at 624; Draper, 164 U.S., at 247.  Indeed, soon after Oklahoma became a State, this Court explained that the grant of statehood may have endowed Oklahoma with authority to try crimes not committed by or against Indians, but with statehood did not come any authority to try crimes by or against Indians on tribal lands.  Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469; see also n.5, supra; Donnelly v. United States,\\n\\n228 U.S. 243, 271 (1913); Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S., at 220; Cohen 506509.  The decision whether and when this arrangement should cease rest[ed] with Congress alone.  Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469. The truth is, Congress has authorized the application of state criminal law on tribal lands for offenses committed by or against Native Americans only in very limited circumstances.  The most notable examples can be found in Public Law 280 and related statutes.  In 1940, Kansas successfully lobbied Congress for criminal jurisdiction in Indian country.  Nearly identical laws for North Dakota, Iowa, and New York followed close behind.  Then in 1953, Congress adopted Public Law 280 in which it authorized five States to exercise criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands and established procedures for additional States to assume similar authority.  In 1968, Congress amended Public Law 280.  Now, before a State like Oklahoma may try crimes by or against Native Americans arising on tribal lands, it must take action to amend any state law disclaiming that authority; then, the State must seek and obtain tribal consent to any extension of state jurisdiction.  See Part IB, supra; Clinton 958962.  Unless a State takes these steps, it does not hav[e] jurisdiction.  25 U.S.C. 1321(a), 1323(b).[6] 5 The Courts suggestion that Oklahoma enjoys inherent authority to try crimes against Native Americans within the Cherokee Reservation makes a mockery of all of Congresss work from 1834 to 1968.  The GCA and MCA?  On the Courts account, Congress foolishly extended federal criminal law to tribal lands on a mistaken assumption that only tribal law would otherwise apply.  Unknown to anyone until today, state law applied all along.  The treaty, the Oklahoma Enabling Act, and the provision in Oklahomas constitution that Congress insisted upon as a condition of statehood?  The Court effectively ignores them.  The Kansas Act and its sibling statutes?  On the Courts account, they were needless too.  Congresss instruction in Public Law 280 that States may not exercise jurisdiction over crimes by or against tribal members on tribal lands until they amend contrary state law and obtain tribal consent?  Once more, it seems the Court thinks Congress was hopelessly misguided.   Through it all, the Court makes no effort to grapple with the backdrop rule of tribal sovereignty.  The Court proceeds oblivious to the rule that only a clear act of Congress may impose constraints on tribal sovereignty.  The Court ignores the fact that Congress has never come close to subjecting the Cherokee to state criminal jurisdiction over crimes against tribal members within the Tribes reservation.  The Court even disregards our precedents recognizing that the grant of statehood to Oklahoma did not endow the State with any power to try crimes committed by or against Indians on tribal lands but reserved that authority to the federal government and Tribes alone.  Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469; see also Tiger, 221 U.S., at 309.  From start to finish, the Court defies our duty to interpret Congresss laws and our own prior work harmoniously as part of an entire corpus juris.  A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 252 (2012); see also Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller,\\n\\n486 U.S. 174, 184185 (1988). C Putting aside these astonishing errors, Congresss work and this Courts precedents yield three clear principles that firmly resolve this case.  First, tribal sovereign authority excludes the operation of other sovereigns criminal laws unless and until Congress ordains otherwise.  Second, while Congress has extended a good deal of federal criminal law to tribal lands, in Oklahoma it has authorized the State to prosecute crimes by or against Native Americans within tribal boundaries only if it satisfies certain requirements.  Under Public Law 280, the State must remove state-law barriers to jurisdiction and obtain tribal consent.  Third, because Oklahoma has done neither of these things, it lacks the authority it seeks to try crimes against tribal members within a tribal reservation.  Until today, all this settled law was well appreciated by this Court, the Executive Branch, and even Oklahoma. Consider first our own precedents and those of other courts.  In 1946 in Williams v. United States, this Court recognized that, while States may have jurisdiction over offenses committed on th[e] reservation between persons who are not Indians, the laws and courts of the United States, rather than those of [the States], have jurisdiction over offenses committed there ... by one who is not an Indian against one who is an Indian.\\n\\n327 U.S. 711, 714 (footnote omitted).  In Williams v. Lee, issued in 1959, this Court was clear again: [I]f the crime was by or against an Indian, tribal jurisdiction or that expressly conferred on other courts by Congress has remained exclusive.  358 U.S., at 220.  As early as 1926, this Court made the same point while speaking directly to Oklahoma.  Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469470.  It is a point our cases have continued to make in recent years.[7]  It is a point a host of other courtsincluding state courts issuing decisions contrary to their own interestshave acknowledged too.[8] The Executive Branch has likewise understood the States to lack authority to try crimes by or against Indians in Indian country absent congressional authorization.  Not only did the Washington Administration recognize as much.  See Part IA, supra.  The same view has persisted throughout the Nations history.  In 1940, the Acting Secretary of the Interior advised Congress that state criminal jurisdiction extends only to situations where both the offender and the victim are non-Indians.  S.Rep. No. 1523, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 2 (Vol. 2).  A few decades later, the Solicitor General made a similar representation to this Court.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Arizona v. Flint, O. T.   1988, No. 88603, p.3 (Flint Amicus Brief).  In McGirt, the federal government once more acknowledged that States cannot prosecute crimes by or against tribal members within still-extant tribal reservations.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in McGirt v. Oklahoma, O. T. 2019, No. 189526, p.38.  In this case, the government has espoused the same view yet again.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4; see also Dept. of Justice, Criminal Resource Manual 685 (updated Jan. 22, 2020).[9] In the past, even Oklahoma has more or less conceded the point.  The last time Oklahoma was before us, it asked this Court to usurp congressional authority and disestablish the Creek Reservation because, otherwise, the State would not have jurisdiction over crimes committed against Indians within its boundaries.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. in McGirt v. Oklahoma, No. 189526, O. T. 2019, p. 54; see also McGirt, 591 U.S., at ______ (slip op., at 3738).  In 1991, Oklahomas attorney general formally resolved that major [c]rimes committed by or against Indians ... are under the exclusive province of the United States, while Tribes retain exclusive jurisdiction over minor crimes committed by Indians.  Haney, 22 Okla. Opp. Atty. Gen. 71, 1991 WL 567868, *3. And Oklahomas own courts have recently taken the same position even in the face of vehement opposition from the States executive branch.  See, e.g., Spears, 485 P.3d, at 875, 877. D Against all this evidence, what is the Courts reply?  It acknowledges that, at the Nations founding, tribal sovereignty precluded States from prosecuting crimes on tribal lands by or against tribal members without congressional authorization.  See ante, at 5.  But the Court suggests this traditional notion flipped 180 degrees sometime in the latter half of the 1800s.  Ante, at 5, 21.  Since then, the Court says, Oklahoma has enjoyed the inherent power to try at least crimes by non-Indians against tribal members on tribal reservations until and unless Congress preempts state authority. But exactly when and how did this change happen?  The Court never explains.  Instead, the Court seeks to cast blame for its ruling on a grab bag of decisions issued by our predecessors.  But the failure of that effort is transparent.  Start with McBratney, which the Court describes as our leading case in the criminal context.  Ante, at 6.  There, as we have seen, the Court said that States admitted to the Union may gain the right to prosecute cases involving only non-Indians on tribal lands, but they do not gain any inherent right to punish crimes committed by or against Indians on tribal lands.  McBratney, 104 U.S., at 624.  The Courts reliance on Draper fares no better, for that case issued a similar disclaimer.  See 164 U.S., at 247.  Tellingly, not even Oklahoma thinks McBratney and Draper compel a ruling in its favor.  See Brief for Petitioner 12.  And if anything, the Courts invocation of Donnelly,\\n\\n228 U.S. 243, is more baffling still.  Ante, at 14, n.3. There, the Court once more reaffirmed the rule that offenses committed by or against Indians on tribal lands remain subject to federal, not state, jurisdiction.  Donnelly, 228 U.S., at 271; see also Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469. That leaves the Court to assemble a string of carefully curated snippetsa clause here, a sentence therefrom six decisions out of the galaxy of this Courts Indian law jurisprudence.  Ante, at 56.  But this collection of cases is no more at fault for the Courts decision than the last.  Organized Village of Kake v. Eganwhich the Court seems to think is some magic bullet, see ante, at 5, 14, n.2, 21, 2224addressed the prosaic question whether Alaska could apply its fishing laws on lands owned by a native Alaska tribal corporation.\\n\\n369 U.S. 60, 6163 (1962); see also n.5, supra.  Subsequently, the Court cabined that case to circumstances dealing with Indians who have left or never inhabited reservations set aside for their exclusive use or who do not possess the usual accoutrements of tribal self-government.  McClanahan, 411 U.S., at 167168.  Meanwhile, New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble allowed New York to use civil proceedings to eject non-Indian trespassers on Indian lands.  21 How. 366, 369371 (1859).  In Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook, the crime at issue did not take place on tribal lands but on a supply station of the United States sold by Arkansas to the federal government.\\n\\n281 U.S. 647, 649 (1930).  In New York exrel. Ray v. Martin, this Court merely reaffirmed McBratney and held that States could exercise jurisdiction over crimes involving only non-Indians.\\n\\n326 U.S. 496, 499500 (1946). Both County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation and Nevada v. Hicks issued holdings about state civil jurisdiction, not criminal jurisdiction striking at the heart of tribal sovereignty.  See\\n\\n502 U.S. 251, 256258, 270 (1992);\\n\\n533 U.S. 353, 361, 363, 374 (2001). In the end, the Court cannot fault our predecessors for todays decision.  The blame belongs only with this Court here and now.  Standing before us is a mountain of statutes and precedents making plain that Oklahoma possesses no authority to prosecute crimes against tribal members on tribal reservations until it amends its laws and wins tribal consent.  This Court may choose to ignore Congresss statutes and the Nations treaties, but it has no power to negate them.  The Court may choose to disregard our precedents, but it does not purport to overrule a single one.  As a result, todays decision surely marks an embarrassing new entry into the anticanon of Indian law.  But its mistakes need notand should notbe repeated. III Doubtless for some of these reasons, even the Court ultimately abandons its suggestion that Oklahoma is inherent[ly] free to prosecute crimes by non-Indians against tribal members on a tribal reservation absent a federal statute preempt[ing] its authority.  Ante, at 15.  In the end, the Court admits that tribal sovereignty can require the exclusion of state authority even absent a preemptive federal statute.  Ante, at 18.  But then, after correcting course, the Court veers off once more.  To determine whether tribal sovereignty displaces state authority in a case involving a non-Indian defendant and an Indian victim on a reservation in Oklahoma, the Court resorts to a Bracker balancing test.  Ibid.  Applying that test, the Court concludes that Oklahomas interests in this case outweigh those of the Cherokee.  All this, too, is mistaken root and branch. A Begin with the most fundamental problem. The Court invokes what it calls the Bracker balancing test with no more appreciation of that decisions history and context than it displays in its initial suggestion that the usual rules of preemption apply to Tribes.  The Court tells us nothing about Bracker itself, its reasoning, or its limits.  Perhaps understandably so, for Bracker never purported to claim for this Court the raw power to balance away tribal sovereignty in favor of state criminal jurisdiction over crimes by or against tribal memberslet alone ordain a wholly different set of jurisdictional rules than Congress already has. Bracker involved a relatively minor civil dispute.  Arizona sought to tax vehicles used by the White Mountain Apache Tribe in logging operations on tribal lands.  See Bracker, 448 U.S., at 138140.  The Tribe opposed the effort, pointing to a federal law that regulated tribal logging but did not say anything about preempting the States vehicle tax.  See id., at 141, 145.  The Court began by recognizing that the usual rules of preemption are not properly applied to Tribes.  Id., at 143.  Instead, the Court started with the traditional backdrop presumption that States lack jurisdiction in Indian country.  Ibid.  And the Court explained that any ambiguities about the scope of federal law must be construed generously in favor of the Tribes as sovereigns.  Id., at 143144.  With these rules in mind, the Court proceeded to turn back the States tax based on a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state, federal, and tribal interests at stake.  Id., at 145.  The Court judged that traditional notions of [tribal] sovereignty, the federal governments policy of promoting tribal self-sufficiency, and the rule requiring it to resolve [a]mbiguities in favor of the Tribe trumped any competing state interest.  Id., at 143144, 151. Nothing in any of this gets the Court close to where it wishes to go.  If Arizona had to proceed against the traditional backdrop rule excluding state jurisdiction, Oklahoma must.  And if Arizona could not overcome that backdrop rule because it could not point to clear federal statutory language authorizing its comparatively minor civil tax, it is unfathomable how Oklahoma might overcome that rule here.  The State has pointedand can pointto nothing in Congresss work granting it the power to try crimes against tribal members on a tribal reservation.  In Bracker, the Court found it instructive that Congress had comprehensive[ly] regulated the harvesting of Indian timber, even if it had not spoken directly to the question of vehicle taxes.  Id., at 145146, 148.  Here, Congress has not only pervasively regulated criminal jurisdiction in Indian country, it has spoken to the very situation we face:  States like Oklahoma may exercise jurisdiction over crimes within tribal boundaries by or against tribal members only with tribal consent. The simple truth is Bracker supplies zero authority for this Courts course today.  If Congress has not always been specific about the allocation of civil jurisdiction in Indian country, the same can hardly be said about the allocation of criminal authority.  Cohen 527.  Congress has provided a nearly comprehensive set of statutes allocating criminal jurisdiction.  Ibid.  In doing so, Congress has already balanced competing tribal, state, and federal interestsand its balance demands tribal consent.  Exactly nothing in Bracker permits us to ignore Congresss directive. B Plainly, the Courts balancing-test game is not one we should be playing in this case.  But what if we did?  Suppose this Court could (somehow) ignore Congresss decision to allow States like Oklahoma to exercise criminal jurisdiction in cases like ours only with tribal consent.  Suppose we could (somehow) replace that rule with one of our own creation.  Even proceeding on that stunning premise, it is far from obvious how the Court arrives at its preferred result. In reweighing competing state and tribal interests for itself, the Court stresses two points.  First, the Court suggests that its balance is designed to help Native Americans.  Ante, at 20 (suggesting that Indians would be second-class citizens without this Courts intervention); Tr. of Oral Arg. 66 (suggesting state jurisdiction is designed to help tribal members). Second, the Court says state jurisdiction is needed on the Cherokee Reservation today because in the wake of McGirt some defendants have simply gone free.  Ante, at 34.  On both counts, however, the Court conspicuously loads the dice. 1 Start with the assertion that allowing state prosecutions in cases like ours will help Indians.  The old paternalist overtones are hard to ignore.  Yes, under the laws Congress has ordained Oklahoma may acquire jurisdiction over crimes by or against tribal members only with tribal consent.  But to date, the Cherokee have misguidedly shown no interest in state jursidiction.  Thanks to their misjudgment, they have rendered themselves second-class citizens.  Ante, at 20. So, the argument goes, five unelected judges in Washington must now make the right choice for the Tribe.  To state the Courts staggering argument should be enough to refute it. Nor does the Court even pause to consider some of the reasons why the Cherokee might not be so eager to invite state prosecutions in cases like ours.  Maybe the Cherokee have so far withheld their consent because, throughout the Nations history, state governments have sometimes proven less than reliable sources of justice for Indian victims.  As early as 1795, George Washington observed that a Jury on the frontiers considering a crime by a non-Indian against an Indian could hardly be got to listen to a charge, much less to convict a culprit.  Letter to E. Pendleton (Jan. 22), in 17 Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 424, 426 (D. Hoth & C. Ebel eds. 2013).  Undoubtedly, too, Georgia once proved among the Cherokees deadliest enemies.  Kagama, 118 U.S., at 384. Maybe the Cherokee also have in mind experiences particular to Oklahoma.  Following statehood, settlers embarked on elaborate schemes to deprive Indians of their lands, rents, and mineral rights.  Many young allottees were virtually kidnaped just before they reached their majority; some were induced to sign deeds at midnight on the morning they became of age.  Debo 197198.  Others were subjected to predatory guardianships; state judges even reward[ed] their supporters [with] guardianship appointments.  Id., at 183.  Oklahomas courts also sometimes sanctioned the legalized robbery of these Native American children through the probate courts.  Id., at 182.  Even almost a century on, the federal government warned of the possibility of prejudice [against Native Americans] in state courts.  Flint Amicus Brief 5. Whatever may have happened in the past, it seems the Court can imagine only a bright new day ahead.  Moving forward, the Court cheerily promises, more prosecuting authorities can only help.  Three sets of prosecutorsfederal, tribal, and stateare sure to prove better than two.  But again its not hard to imagine reasons why the Cherokee might see things differently.  If more sets of prosecutors are always better, why not allow Texas to enforce its laws in California?  Few sovereigns or their citizens would see that as an improvement.  Yet it seems the Court cannot grasp why the Tribe may not. The Court also neglects to consider actual experience with concurrent state jurisdiction on tribal lands.  According to a group of former United States Attorneys, in practice concurrent jurisdiction has sometimes create[d] a pass-the-buck dynamic ... with the end result being fewer police and more crime.  Brief for Former United States Attorneys etal. as Amici Curiae 13; see also C. Goldberg, Public Law 280: The Limits of State Jurisdiction Over Reservation Indians, 22 UCLA L. Rev. 535, 552, and n.92 (1975); Goldberg-Ambrose 1423.  Federal authorities may reduce their involvement when state authorities are present.  In turn, some States may not wish to devote the resources required and may view the responsibility as an unfunded federal mandate.  Thanks to realities like these, [a]lmost as soon as Congress began granting States [criminal] jurisdiction through Public Law 280, affected Tribal Nations began seeking retrocession and repeal.  Brief for National Indigenous Womens Resource Center et al. as Amici Curiae 12.  Recently, a bipartisan congressional commission agreed that more state criminal jurisdiction in Indian country is often not a good policy choice.  See Indian Law and Order Commission, A Roadmap for Making Native America Safer: Report to the President and Congress of the United States xi, xiv, 1115 (Nov. 2013).  Still, none of this finds its way into the Courts cost-benefit analysis. 2 Instead, the Court marches on.  The second factor it weighs in its balanceand the only history it seems interested in consultingconcerns Oklahomas account of its experiences in the last two years since McGirt.  Adopting the States representations wholesale, the Court says that decision has posed Oklahoma with law-and-order challenge[s].  Ante, at 4.  To support its thesis, the Court cites the States unsubstantiated estimat[e] that McGirt has forced it to transfer prosecutorial responsibility for more than 18,000 cases per year to federal and tribal authorities.  Ibid.  Apparently on the belief that the transfer of cases from state to federal prosecutors equates to an eruption of chaos and criminality, the Court remarks casually that traditional limitations on state prosecutorial authority on tribal lands were insignificant in the real world before McGirt.  Ante, at 16. But what does this prove?  Put aside for the moment questions about the accuracy of Oklahomas statistics and what the number of cases transferred from state to federal prosecutors may or may not mean for law and order.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26 (questioning whether the States figures might be grossly exaggerated).  Taking the Courts account at face value, it might amount to a reason for Oklahoma to lobby the Cherokee to consent to state jurisdiction.  It might be a reason for the State to petition Congress to revise criminal jurisdictional arrangements in the State even without tribal consent.  But it is no act of statutory or constitutional interpretation.  It is a policy argument through and through. Nor is the Courts policy argument exactly complete in its assessment of the costs and benefits.  When this Court issued McGirt, it expressly acknowledged that cases involving crimes by or against tribal members within reservation boundaries would have to be transferred from state to tribal or federal authorities.  591 U.S., at ______ (slip op., at 3642).  This Court anticipated, too, that this process would require a period of readjustment.  But, the Court recognized, all this was necessary only because Oklahoma had long overreached its authority on tribal reservations and defied legally binding congressional promises.  See ibid. Notably, too, neither the tribal nor the federal authorities on the receiving end of this new workload think the costs of this period of readjustment begin to justify the Courts course.  For their part, Tribes in Oklahoma have hired more police officers, prosecutors, and judges.  See Cherokee Brief 1011.  Based on that investment, Oklahomas Tribes have begun to prosecute substantially more cases than they once did.  See id., at 1213.  And they have also shown a willingness to work with Oklahoma, having signed hundreds of cross-deputization agreements allowing local law enforcement to collaborate with tribal police.  Id., at 1516, and n.39.  Even Oklahomas amici concede these agreements have proved an important tool for law enforcement.  Brief for Oklahoma District Attorneys Association etal. as Amici Curiae 14. Both of the federal governments elected branches have also responded, if not in the way this Court happens to prefer.  Instead of forcing state criminal jurisdiction onto Tribes, Congress has chosen to allocate additional funds for law enforcement in Oklahoma.  See, e.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, H.R. 2471, 117th Cong., 2d Sess., 78 (2022).  Meanwhile, the Solicitor General has offered the Executive Branchs judgment that McGirts practical consequences do not justify this Courts intervention, explaining that the Department of Justice is working diligently with tribal and State partners in Oklahoma.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 32. There is even more evidence cutting against the Courts dystopian tale.  According to a recent United States Attorney in Oklahoma, the sky isnt falling and partnerships between tribal law enforcement and state law enforcement are strong.  A.Herrera, Trent Shores Reflects on His Time as U.S. Attorney, Remains Committed to Justice for Indian Country, KOSU-NPR (Feb. 24, 2021), www.kosu.org/politics/2021-02-24/trent-shores-reflects-on-his-time-as-u-s-attorney-remains-committed-to-justice-for-indian-country.  A Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent in charge of Oklahoma has stated that violent crimes are being pursued as heavily as they were in the past, and in some cases, maybe even stronger.  A. Brothers, Oklahoma Special Agent Says FBI Faces Challenges in 3 Categories, News on 6 (Feb. 14, 2022),https://www.newson6.com/story/620b261bf8cd4a07e5cb845b/oklahoma-special-agent-says-fbi-faces-challenges-in-3-categories.  And the Tribesthose most affected by all this supposed lawlessness within their reservationstell us that, after a period of adjustment, federal prosecutors are now pursuing lower level offenses vigorously too.  See Brief for Muscogee (Creek) Nation as Amicus Curiae on Pet. for Cert. 1112, and nn.2122 (collecting indictments).  The federal government has made a similar representation to this Court.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 118.  Nor is it any secret that those convicted of federal crimes generally receive longer sentences than individuals convicted of similar state offenses.  See, e.g., Bureau of Justice Statistics, Felony Sentences in State Courts, 2006Statistical Tables 9 (2009) (Table 1.6). In recounting all this, I do not profess certainty about the optimal law enforcement arrangements in Oklahoma.  I do not pretend to know all the relevant facts, let alone how to balance each of them in this complex picture.  Nor do I claim to know what weight to give historical wrongs or future hopes.  I offer the preceding observations only to illustrate the one thing I am sure of:  This Court has no business usurping congressional decisions about the appropriate balance between federal, tribal, and state interests.  If the Courts ruling today sounds like a legislative committee report touting the benefits of some newly proposed bill, thats because it is exactly that.  And given that a nine-member court is a poor substitute for the peoples elected representatives, it is no surprise that the Courts cost-benefit analysis is radically incomplete.  The Courts decision is not a judicial interpretation of the laws meaning; it is the pastiche of a legislative process. C As unsound as the Courts decision is, it would be a mistake to overlook its limits.  In the end, the Court admits that tribal sovereignty can displace state authority even without a preemptive statute.  See Part IIIA, supra.  To be sure, the Court proceeds to disparage a federal statute requiring Oklahoma to obtain tribal consent before trying any crime involving an Indian victim within the Cherokee Reservation.  But look at what the Court leaves unresolved.  The Court does not pass on Public Law 280s provision that States shall not be entitled to assume jurisdiction on tribal lands until they appropriately amen[d] state laws disclaiming authority over tribal reservations.\\n\\n25 U.S.C.  1324.  The Court gestures toward the Cherokees treaties and the Oklahoma Enabling Act, but ultimately abandons any argument that those treaties were lawfully abrogated or that the Oklahoma Enabling Act endowed Oklahoma with inherent authority to try cases involving Native Americans within tribal bounds.  See ante, at 18. Nor does the Court address the relevant text of those treaties or the Enabling Actlet alone come to terms with our precedents holding that Oklahomas grant of statehood did not include the power to try crimes committed by or against Indians on tribal lands.  Ramsey, 271 U.S., at 469; see also Tiger, 221 U.S., at 309.  Nothing in todays decision could or does begin to preclude the Cherokee or other Tribes from pressing arguments along any of these lines in future cases.  The unamended Oklahoma Constitution and other state statutes and judicial decisions may stand as independent barriers to the assumption of state jurisdiction as a matter of state law too. The Courts decision is limited in still other important ways.  Most significantly, the Court leaves undisturbed the ancient rule that States cannot prosecute crimes by Native Americans on tribal lands without clear congressional authorizationfor that would touch the heart of tribal self-government.  Ante, at 17.  At least that rule (and maybe others) can never be balanced away.  Indeed, the Courts ruling today rests in significant part on the fact that Tribes currently lack criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians who commit crimes on tribal landsa factor that obviously does not apply to cases involving Native American defendants.  Ante, at 19. Additionally, nothing in the Bracker balancing test the Court employs foreordains todays grim result for different Tribes in different States.  Bracker instructs courts to focus on the specific context at issue, taking cognizance of the particular circumstances of the Tribe in question, including all relevant treaties and statutes.  448 U.S., at 145.  Nor are Tribes and their treaties fungible.  S.Prakash, Against Tribal Fungibility, 89 Cornell L. Rev. 1069, 10711072 (2004).  There are nearly 600 federally recognized Indian Tribes across the country.  See Anderson 3.  Some of their treaties appear to promise tribal freedom from state criminal jurisdiction in express terms.  See, e.g., Treaty with the Navajo, Art. I, June 1868,\\n\\n15Stat.\\n667 (guaranteeing that those who commit crimes against tribal members will be arrested and punished according to the laws of the United States).  Any analysis true to Bracker must take cognizance of all of this.  Any such analysis must recognize, too, that the standards of preemption applicable in other areas of the law are unhelpful when it comes to Tribes.  Bracker, 448 U.S., at 143.  Instead, courts must proceed against the backdrop of tribal sovereignty, ibid., with an assumption that the States have no power to regulate the affairs of Indians on a reservation or other tribal lands, Williams, 358 U.S., at 219220.  To overcome that backdrop assumption, a clear congressional statement is required and any ambiguities must be construed generously in favor of the Tribes.  Bracker, 448 U.S., at 143144; see also Cotton Petroleum, 490 U.S., at 177178.  The Court today may ignore a clear jurisdictional rule prescribed by statute and choose to apply its own balancing test instead.  The Court may misapply that balancing test in an effort to address one States professed law and order concerns.  In the process, the Court may even risk unsettling longstanding and clear jurisdictional rules nationwide.  But in the end, any faithful application of Bracker to other Tribes in other States should only confirm the soundness of the traditional rule that state authorities may not try crimes like this one absent congressional authorization.[10] Nor must Congress stand by as this Court sows needless confusion across the country.  Even the Court acknowledges that Congress can undo its decision and preempt state authority at any time.  Ante, at 6.  And Congress could do exactly that with a simple amendment to Public Law 280.  It might say:  A State lacks criminal jurisdiction over crimes by or against Indians in Indian Country, unless the State complies with the procedures to obtain tribal consent outlined in\\n\\n25 U.S.C.  1321, and, where necessary, amends its constitution or statutes pursuant to\\n\\n25 U.S.C.  1324.  Of course, that reminder of the obvious should hardly be necessary.  But thanks to this Courts egregious misappropriation of legislative authority, the ball is back in Congress court.  Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.,\\n\\n550 U.S. 618, 661 (2007) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). * In the 1830s, this Court struggled to keep our Nations promises to the Cherokee.  Justice Story celebrated the decision in Worcester: [T]hanks be to God, the Court can wash [its] hands clean of the iniquity of oppressing the Indians and disregarding their rights.  Breyer 420.  The Court had done its duty, even if Georgia refused to do its own.  Ibid.  Today, the tables turn.  Oklahomas courts exercised the fortitude to stand athwart their own States lawless disregard of the Cherokees sovereignty.  Now, at the bidding of Oklahomas executive branch, this Court unravels those lower-court decisions, defies Congresss statutes requiring tribal consent, offers its own consent in place of the Tribes, and allows Oklahoma to intrude on a feature of tribal sovereignty recognized since the founding.  One can only hope the political branches and future courts will do their duty to honor this Nations promises even as we have failed today to do our own.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":46}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"UcQGkI4BQk0d"},"id":"UcQGkI4BQk0d","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"VqVZIgGbkanJ","outputId":"e5e8e1cf-85e0-4716-a76d-010e76602207"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["tokeized

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus biden etal. v. texas etal. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit No. 21954.Argued April 26, 2022Decided June 30, 2022 In January 2019, the Department of Homeland Security began to implement the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).  Under MPP, certain non-Mexican nationals arriving by land from Mexico were returned to Mexico to await the results of their removal proceedings under section 1229a of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).  MPP was implemented pursuant to a provision of the INA that applies to aliens arriving on land . . . from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States and provides that the Secretary of Homeland Security may return the alien to that territory pending a proceeding under section 1229a.\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C).  Following a change in Presidential administrations, the Biden administration announced that it would suspend the program, and on June 1, 2021, the Secretary of Homeland Security issued a memorandum officially terminating it.  The States of Texas and Missouri (respondents) brought suit in the Northern District of Texas against the Secretary and others, asserting that the June 1 Memorandum violated the INA and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  The District Court entered judgment for respondents.  The court first concluded that terminating MPP would violate the INA, reasoning that section 1225 of the INA provides the government two options with respect to illegal entrants: mandatory detention pursuant to section 1225(b)(2)(A) or contiguous-territory return pursuant to section 1225(b)(2)(C).  554 F.Supp. 3d 818, 852.  Because the Government was unable to meet its mandatory detention obligations under section 1225(b)(2)(A) due to resource constraints, the court reasoned, terminating MPP would necessarily lead to the systemic violation of section 1225 as illegal entrants were released into the United States.  Second, the District Court concluded that the June 1 Memorandum was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.  The District Court vacated the June 1 Memorandum and remanded to DHS.  It also imposed a nationwide injunction ordering the Government to enforce and implement MPP in good faith until such a time as it has been lawfully rescinded in compliance with the APA and until such a time as the federal government has sufficient detention capacity to detain all aliens subject to mandatory detention under [section 1225] without releasing any aliens because of a lack of detention resources.  Id., at 857 (emphasis in original). While the Governments appeal was pending, the Secretary released the October 29 Memoranda, which again announced the termination of MPP and explained anew his reasons for doing so.  The Government then moved to vacate the injunction on the ground that the October 29 Memoranda had superseded the June 1 Memorandum.  But the Court of Appeals denied the motion and instead affirmed the District Courts judgment in full.  With respect to the INA question, the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Courts analysis that terminating the program would violate the INA, concluding that the return policy was mandatory so long as illegal entrants were being released into the United States.  The Court of Appeals also held that [t]he October 29 Memoranda did not constitute a new and separately reviewable final agency action.  20 F. 4th 928, 951.   Held:The Governments rescission of MPP did not violate section 1225 of the INA, and the October 29 Memoranda constituted final agency action.  Pp. 825. (a)Beginning with jurisdiction, the injunction that the District Court entered in this case violated\n","\n","8 U.S. C. 1252(f)(1).  See Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. ___, ___.  But section 1252(f)(1) does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction to reach the merits of an appeal even where a lower court enters a form of relief barred by that provision.  Section 1252(f)(1) withdraws a district courts jurisdiction or authority to grant a particular form of relief.  It does not deprive lower courts of all subject matter jurisdiction over claims brought under sections 1221 through 1232 of the INA.   The text of the provision makes that clear.  Section 1252(f)(1) deprives courts of the power to issue a specific category of remedies: those that enjoin or restrain the operation of the relevant sections of the statute.  And Congress included that language in a provision whose titleLimit on injunctive reliefmakes clear the narrowness of its scope.  Moreover, the provision contains a parenthetical that explicitly preserves this Courts power to enter injunctive relief.  If section 1252(f)(1) deprived lower courts of subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate any non-individual claims under sections 1221 through 1232, no such claims could ever arrive at this Court, rendering the specific carveout for Supreme Court injunctive relief nugatory. Statutory structure likewise confirms this conclusion.  Elsewhere in section 1252, where Congress intended to deny subject matter jurisdiction over a particular class of claims, it did so unambiguously.  See, e.g., 1252(a)(2) (entitled Matters not subject to judicial review).  Finally, this Court previously encountered a virtually identical situation in Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. ___, and proceeded to reach the merits of the suit notwithstanding the District Courts apparent violation of section 1252(f)(1).  Pp.813. (b)Turning to the merits, section 1225(b)(2)(C) provides: In the case of an alien ... who is arriving on land ... from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States, the [Secretary] may return the alien to that territory pending a proceeding under section 1229a.  Section 1225(b)(2)(C) plainly confers a discretionary authority to return aliens to Mexico.  This Court has repeatedly observed that the word may clearly connotes discretion.  Opati v. Republic of Sudan, 590 U.S. ___, ___.   Respondents and the Court of Appeals concede that point, but urge an inference from the statutory structure: because section 1225(b)(2)(A) makes detention mandatory, they argue, the otherwise-discretionary return authority in section 1225(b)(2)(C) becomes mandatory when the Secretary violates that mandate.  The problem is that the statute does not say anything like that.  The statute says may.  If Congress had intended section 1225(b)(2)(C) to operate as a mandatory cure of any noncompliance with the Governments detention obligations, it would not have conveyed that intention through an unspoken inference in conflict with the unambiguous, express term may.  The contiguous-territory return authority in section 1225(b)(2)(C) is discretionaryand remains discretionary notwithstanding any violation of section 1225(b)(2)(A).   The historical context in which section 1225(b)(2)(C) was adopted confirms the plain import of its text.  Section 1225(b)(2)(C) was added to the statute more than 90 years after the shall be detained language that appears in section 1225(b)(2)(A).  And the provision was enacted in response to a BIA decision that had questioned the legality of the contiguous-territory return practice.  Moreover, since its enactment, every Presidential administration has interpreted section 1225(b)(2)(C) as purely discretionary, notwithstanding the consistent shortfall of funds to comply with section 1225(b)(2)(A).   The foreign affairs consequences of mandating the exercise of contiguous-territory return likewise confirm that the Court of Appeals erred.  Interpreting section 1225(b)(2)(C) as a mandate imposes a significant burden upon the Executives ability to conduct diplomatic relations with Mexico, one that Congress likely did not intend section 1225(b)(2)(C) to impose.  And finally, the availability of parole as an alternative means of processing applicants for admission, see\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A), additionally makes clear that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the INA required the Government to continue implementing MPP.  Pp. 1318. (c)The Court of Appeals also erred in holding that [t]he October 29 Memoranda did not constitute a new and separately reviewable final agency action.  20 F. 4th, at 951.  Once the District Court vacated the June 1 Memorandum and remanded to DHS for further consideration, DHS had two options: elaborate on its original reasons for taking action or deal with the problem afresh by taking new agency action.  Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. ___, ___.  The Secretary selected the second option from Regents: He accepted the District Courts vacatur and dealt with the problem afresh.  The October 29 Memoranda were therefore final agency action for the same reasons that the June 1 Memorandum was final agency action: Both mark[ed] the consummation of the agencys decisionmaking process and resulted in rights and obligations [being] determined.  Bennett v. Spear,\n","\n","520 U.S. 154, 178.   The various rationales offered by respondents and the Court of Appeals in support of the contrary conclusion lack merit.  First, the Court of Appeals erred to the extent it understood itself to be reviewing an abstract decision apart from the specific agency actions contained in the June 1 Memorandum and October 29 Memoranda.  Second, and relatedly, the October 29 Memoranda were not a mere posthoc rationalization of the June 1 Memorandum.  The prohibition on posthoc rationalization applies only when the agency proceeds by the first option from Regents.  Here, the Secretary chose the second option from Regents and issue[d] a new rescission bolstered by new reasons absent from the [June 1] Memorandum.  591 U.S., at ___.  Having returned to the drawing table, the Secretary was not subject to the charge of posthoc rationalization.   Third, respondents invoke Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. ___.  But nothing in this record suggests a significant mismatch between the decision the Secretary made and the rationale he provided.  Id., at ___.  Relatedly, the Court of Appeals charged that the Secretary failed to proceed with a sufficiently open mind.  But this Court has previously rejected criticisms of agency closemindedness based on an identity between proposed and final agency action.  See Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 591 U.S. ___, ___.  Finally, the Court of Appeals erred to the extent it viewed the Governments decision to appeal the District Courts injunction as relevant to the question of the October 29 Memorandas status as final agency action.  Nothing prevents an agency from undertaking new agency action while simultaneously appealing an adverse judgment against its original action.  Pp.1825. 20 F.4th 928, reversed and remanded.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21954 _________________ JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, etal., PETITIONERS v. TEXAS, etal. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit [June 30, 2022]  Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court. In January 2019, the Department of Homeland Securityunder the administration of President Trumpestablished the Migrant Protection Protocols.  That program provided for the return to Mexico of non-Mexican aliens who had been detained attempting to enter the United States illegally from Mexico.  On Inauguration Day 2021, the new administration of President Biden announced that the program would be suspended the next day, and later that year sought to terminate it.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals, however, held that doing so would violate the Immigration and Nationality Act, concluding that the return policy was mandatory so long as illegal entrants were being released into the United States.  The District Court also held that the attempted rescission of the program was inadequately explained in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.  While its appeal was pending, the Government took new action to terminate the policy with a more detailed explanation.  But the Court of Appeals held that this new action was not separately reviewable final agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act. The questions presented are whether the Governments rescission of the Migrant Protection Protocols violated the Immigration and Nationality Act and whether the Governments second termination of the policy was a valid final agency action. I A On December 20, 2018, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen announced a new program called Remain in Mexico, also known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).  MPP was created in response to an immigration surge at the countrys southern border, and a resulting humanitarian and border security crisis in which federal immigration officials were encountering approximately 2,000 inadmissible aliens each day.  554 F.Supp. 3d 818, 831 (ND Tex. 2021).  MPP provided that certain non-Mexican nationals arriving by land from Mexico would be returned to Mexico to await the results of their removal proceedings under\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1229a.  On the same day that Secretary Nielsen announced the program, the Government of Mexico agreed that it would cooperate in administering it, on a temporary basis. MPP was implemented pursuant to express congressional authorization in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which provides that [i]n the case of an alien ... who is arriving on land (whether or not at a designated port of arrival) from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States, the Attorney General may return the alien to that territory pending a proceeding under section 1229a of this title.\n","\n","66Stat.\n","163, as added and amended,\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C).[1]  Prior to the initiation of MPP, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its predecessor agency had primarily used [1225(b)(2)(C)] on an ad-hoc basis to return certain Mexican and Canadian nationals arriving at ports of entry.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 273a, n.12. A separate provision of the same section of the INA states that if an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a proceeding under section 1229a of this title.  1225(b)(2)(A).  Due to consistent and significant funding shortfalls, however, DHS has never had sufficient detention capacity to maintain in custody every single person described in section 1225.  Id., at 323a.  In light of that fact, the Trump administration chose to implement MPP in part so that [c]ertain aliens attempting to enter the U.S. illegally or without documentation, including those who claim asylum, will no longer be released into the country, where they often fail to file an asylum application and/or disappear before an immigration judge can determine the merits of any claim.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 832. In January 2019, DHS began implementing MPP, initially in San Diego, California, then in El Paso, Texas, and Calexico, California, and then nationwide.  By December 31, 2020, DHS had enrolled 68,039 aliens in the program. Following the change in Presidential administrations, however, the Biden administration sought to terminate the program.  On January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security wrote that [e]ffective January 21, 2021, the Department will suspend new enrollments in [MPP] pending further review of the program.  Aliens who are not already enrolled in MPP should be processed under other existing legal authorities.  Id., at 836.  President Biden also issued Executive Order No. 14010, which directed the new Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, to promptly review and determine whether to terminate or modify the [MPP] program.  86 Fed. Reg. 8269 (2021). On June 1, 2021, Secretary Mayorkas issued a memorandum officially terminating MPP (the June 1 Memorandum).  In that memorandum, the Secretary noted his determination that MPP [d]oes not adequately or sustainably enhance border management in such a way as to justify the programs extensive operational burdens and other shortfalls.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 351a.  He also emphasized that, since its inception, MPP had played an outsized role in [DHSs] engagement with the Government of Mexico, given the significant attention that it draws away from other elements that necessarily must be more central to the bilateral relationship.  Id., at 357a.  For those and other reasons, the Secretary announced that he was by this memorandum terminating the MPP program, and direct[ed] DHS personnel to take all appropriate actions to terminate MPP, including taking all steps necessary to rescind implementing guidance and other directives or policy guidance issued to implement the program.  Id., at 348a349a. B On April 13, 2021, the States of Texas and Missouri (respondents) initiated this lawsuit in the Northern District of Texas against Secretary Mayorkas and others.  Respondents initial complaint challenged the Acting Secretarys January 20 suspension of new enrollments in MPP, but following the June 1 Memorandum, they amended their complaint to challenge the Secretarys June 1 rescission of the entire program.  The amended complaint asserted that the June 1 Memorandum violated the INA and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),\n","\n","5 U.S.C. 701 etseq., and sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and vacatur of the rescission pursuant to the APA. The District Court conducted a one-day bench trial and entered judgment for respondents.  The court first concluded that terminating MPP would violate the INA.  It reasoned that section 1225 of the INA provides the government two options: mandatory detention pursuant to section 1225(b)(2)(A) or contiguous-territory return pursuant to section 1225(b)(2)(C).  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 852.  Because the Government was unable to meet its detention obligations under section 1225(b)(2)(A) due to resource constraints, the court concluded, terminating MPP necessarily leads to the systemic violation of Section 1225 as aliens are released into the United States.  Ibid.  Second, the District Court found that the agency failed to engage in reasoned decisionmaking and therefore acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the APA.  Id., at 847851. Based on these conclusions, the District Court vacated [the June 1 Memorandum] in its entirety and remanded to DHS for further consideration.  Id., at 857 (boldface and capitalization omitted).  And it imposed a nationwide injunction ordering the Government to enforce and implement MPP in good faith until such a time as it has been lawfully rescinded in compliance with the APA and until such a time as the federal government has sufficient detention capacity to detain all aliens subject to mandatory detention under [section 1225] without releasing any aliens because of a lack of detention resources.  Ibid. (emphasis in original). The Government appealed and sought a stay of the injunction, which the District Court and the Court of Appeals each denied.  The Government then applied to this Court for a stay.  The Court denied the application, finding that the Government had failed to show a likelihood of success on the claim that the [June 1 Memorandum] was not arbitrary and capricious.  594 U.S. ___ (2021).  The Court did not address the District Courts interpretation of the INA. The parties proceeded to briefing in the Court of Appeals.  While the Governments appeal was pending, however, Secretary Mayorkas considered anew whether to maintain, terminate, or modify MPP in various ways.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 286a.  On September 29, 2021, the Secretary publicly announced his inten[tion] to issue in the coming weeks a new memorandum terminating [MPP].  20 F. 4th 928, 954 (CA5 2021).  The Government then moved to hold the appeal in abeyance pending the Secretarys formal decision, but the Court of Appeals denied the motion. On October 29, the Secretary released a four-page memorandum that again announced the termination of MPP, along with a 39-page addendum explaining his reasons for doing so (the October 29 Memoranda).  As the Secretary explained, this new assessment of MPP examined considerations that the District Court determined were insufficiently addressed in the June 1 memo, including claims that MPP discouraged unlawful border crossings, decreased the filing of non-meritorious asylum claims, and facilitated more timely relief for asylum seekers, as well as predictions that termination of MPP would lead to a border surge, cause [DHS] to fail to comply with alleged detention obligations under the [INA], impose undue costs on states, and put a strain on U.S.-Mexico relations.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 259a260a. The Secretary acknowledged what he called the strongest argument in favor of retaining MPP: namely, the significant decrease in border encounters following the determination to implement MPP across the southern border.  Id., at 261a.  But he nonetheless concluded that the programs benefits do not justify the costs, particularly given the way in which MPP detracts from other regional and domestic goals, foreign-policy objectives, and domestic policy initiatives that better align with this Administrations values.  Ibid.  Finally, the Secretary once again noted that [e]fforts to implement MPP have played a particularly outsized role in diplomatic engagements with Mexico, diverting attention from more productive efforts to fight transnational criminal and smuggling networks and address the root causes of migration.  Id., at 262a. In light of those conclusions, the Secretary announced that he was once again hereby terminating MPP.  Id., at 263a.  He explained that DHS would continue complying with the [District Courts] injunction requiring good-faith implementation and enforcement of MPP.  Id., at 264a.  But he noted that the termination of MPP would be implemented as soon as practicable after a final judicial decision to vacate that injunction.  Ibid.  The Government then moved to vacate the injunction on the ground that the October 29 Memoranda had superseded the June 1 Memorandum, but the Court of Appeals denied the motion. The Court of Appeals instead affirmed the District Courts judgment in full.  With respect to the INA question, the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Courts analysis of the relevant provisions.  That is, the court explained, section 1225(b)(2)(A) sets forth a general, plainly obligatory rule: detention for aliens seeking admission, while section 1225(b)(2)(C) authorizes contiguous-territory return as an alternative.  20 F. 4th, at 996.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals reasoned, DHS is violating (A)s mandate, refusing to avail itself of (C)s authorized alternative, and then complaining that it doesnt like its options.  Ibid., n.18. The Court of Appeals also held that [t]he October 29 Memoranda did not constitute a new and separately reviewable final agency action.  Id., at 951.  The Court of Appeals distinguished DHSs June 1 decision to terminate MPP, which it claimed had legal effect, from the June 1 Memorandum, the October 29 Memoranda, and any other subsequent memos, which it held simply explained DHSs decision.  Ibid.  The Court of Appeals then criticized the Government for proceeding without a hint of an intention to put the Termination Decision back on the chopping block and rethink things, and for ultimately just further defend[ing] what it had previously decided.  Id., at 955.  And the Court of Appeals drew a dichotomy between taking new agency action and appealing an adverse decision, asserting that DHS chose not to take a new agency action but instead chose to notice an appeal and defend its Termination Decision in our court.  Id., at 941. We granted certiorari, 595 U.S. ___ (2022), and expedited consideration of this appeal at the Governments request. II We begin with jurisdiction.  The Government contends that the injunction the District Court entered was barred by\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1252(f)(1).  That provision reads as follows: Regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party or parties bringing the action, no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of [8 U.S.C. 12211232], other than with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under [those provisions] have been initiated. As we recently held in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. ___ (2022), section 1252(f)(1) generally prohibits lower courts from entering injunctions that order federal officials to take or to refrain from taking actions to enforce, implement, or otherwise carry out the specified statutory provisions.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  The District Courts injunction in this case violated that provision.  But that fact simply presents us with the following question: whether section 1252(f)(1) deprives this Court of jurisdiction to reach the merits of an appeal, where the lower court entered a form of relief barred by that provision.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment,\n","\n","523 U.S. 83, 95 (1998) (Every federal appellate court has an obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review, even though the parties are prepared to concede it. (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). Absent section 1252(f)(1), the District Court clearly had federal question jurisdiction over respondents suit, which asserted claims arising under two federal statutes, the INA and the APA.  See\n","\n","28 U.S.C. 1331 (The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.).  The question, then, is whether section 1252(f)(1) strips the lower courts of subject matter jurisdiction over these claims.  The parties agree that the answer to that question is no, and so do we.  That is because section 1252(f)(1) withdraws a district courts jurisdiction or authority to grant a particular form of relief.  It does not deprive the lower courts of all subject matter jurisdiction over claims brought under sections 1221 through 1232 of the INA. The text of the provision makes that clear.  Section 1252(f)(1) deprives courts of the power to issue a specific category of remedies: those that enjoin or restrain the operation of the relevant sections of the statute.  A limitation on subject matter jurisdiction, by contrast, restricts a courts power to adjudicate a case.  United States v. Cotton,\n","\n","535 U.S. 625, 630 (2002).  Section 1252(f)(1) bears no indication that lower courts lack power to hear any claim brought under sections 1221 through 1232.  If Congress had wanted the provision to have that effect, it could have said so in words far simpler than those that it wrote.  But Congress instead provided that lower courts would lack jurisdiction to enjoin or restrain the operation of the relevant provisions, and it included that language in a provision whose titleLimit on injunctive reliefmakes clear the narrowness of its scope. A second feature of the text of section 1252(f)(1) leaves no doubt that this Court has jurisdiction: the parenthetical explicitly preserving this Courts power to enter injunctive relief.  See 1252(f)(1) ([N]o court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority ...).  If section 1252(f)(1) deprived lower courts of subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate any non-individual claims under sections 1221 through 1232, no such claims could ever arrive at this Court, rendering the provisions specific carveout for Supreme Court injunctive relief nugatory.  Indeed, that carveout seems directed at precisely the question before us here: whether section 1252(f)(1)s [l]imit on injunctive relief has any consequence for the jurisdiction of this Court.  Congress took pains to answer that question in the negative.  Interpreting section 1252(f)(1) to deprive this Court of jurisdiction under these circumstances would therefore fail to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of [the] statute.  Williams v. Taylor,\n","\n","529 U.S. 362, 404 (2000).[2] Statutory structure confirms our conclusion.  Elsewhere in section 1252, where Congress intended to deny subject matter jurisdiction over a particular class of claims, it did so unambiguously.  Section 1252(a)(2), for instance, is entitled Matters not subject to judicial review and provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review several categories of decisions, such as any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense....  (Emphasis added.)  Congress could easily have added one more item to this list: any action taken pursuant to sections 1221 through 1232.  Or it could have worded section 1252(f)(1) similarly to the immediately adjacent section 1252(g), which provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against [the alien].  (Emphasis added.)  But Congress did neither.  Instead, it constructed a carefully worded provision depriving the lower courts of power to enjoin or restrain the operation of certain sections of the statute, and it entitled that provision a [l]imit on injunctive relief. Our prior cases have already embraced this straightforward conclusion.  Most relevantly, the Court previously encountered a virtually identical situation in Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. ___ (2019).  There, as here, the plaintiffs sought declaratory as well as injunctive relief in their complaint, and there, as here, the District Court awarded only the latter.  Yet this Court proceeded to reach the merits of the suit, notwithstanding the District Courts apparent violation of section 1252(f)(1), by reasoning that [w]hether the [District] [C]ourt had jurisdiction to enter such an injunction is irrelevant because the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs request for declaratory relief.  Id., at ______ (Alito, J., joined by Roberts, C. J., and Kavanaugh, J.) (slip op., at 89); see also Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. ___, ___ (2018) (Breyer, J., joined by Ginsburg and Sotomayor, JJ., dissenting) (slip op., at 31) (concluding that a court could order declaratory relief notwithstanding section 1252(f)(1)).  Our disposition in Preap is inconsistent with an interpretation of the limitation in section 1252(f)(1) that strips the lower courts of subject matter jurisdiction.[3]  And previous statements from this Court regarding section 1252(f)(1) are in accord.  See Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm.,\n","\n","525 U.S. 471, 481 (1999) (By its plain terms, and even by its title, [section 1252(f)(1)] is nothing more or less than a limit on injunctive relief.). In short, we see no basis for the conclusion that section 1252(f)(1) concerns subject matter jurisdiction.  It is true that section 1252(f)(1) uses the phrase jurisdiction or authority, rather than simply the word authority.  But [j]urisdiction ... is a word of many, too many meanings.  Steel Co., 523 U.S., at 90.  And the question whether a court has jurisdiction to grant a particular remedy is different from the question whether it has subject matter jurisdiction over a particular class of claims.  See Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick,\n","\n","559 U.S. 154, 163164 (2010) (concluding that [t]he word jurisdiction ... says nothing about whether a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate claims).  Section 1252(f)(1) no doubt deprives the lower courts of jurisdiction to grant classwide injunctive relief.  See Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  But that limitation poses no obstacle to jurisdiction in this Court.[4] III We now turn to the merits.  Section 1225(b)(2)(C) provides: In the case of an alien ... who is arriving on land ... from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States, the [Secretary] may return the alien to that territory pending a proceeding under section 1229a.  Section 1225(b)(2)(C) plainly confers a discretionary authority to return aliens to Mexico during the pendency of their immigration proceedings.  This Court has repeatedly observed that the word may clearly connotes discretion.  Opati v. Republic of Sudan, 590 U.S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 10) (emphasis in original); see also, e.g., Weyerhaeuser Co. v. United States Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U.S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 14); Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,\n","\n","543 U.S. 335, 346 (2005).  The use of the word may in section 1225(b)(2)(C) thus makes clear that contiguous-territory return is a tool that the Secretary has the authority, but not the duty, to use.  Lopez v. Davis,\n","\n","531 U.S. 230, 241 (2001). Respondents and the Court of Appeals concede this point.  Brief for Respondents 21 (contiguous-territory return is a discretionary authority); 20 F. 4th, at 996, n.18 (Its obviously true that 1225(b)(2)(C) is discretionary.).  They base their interpretation instead on section 1225(b)(2)(A), which provides that, in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a proceeding under section 1229a of this title.  Respondents and the Court of Appeals thus urge an inference from the statutory structure: Because section 1225(b)(2)(A) makes detention mandatory, they argue, the otherwise-discretionary return authority in section 1225(b)(2)(C) becomes mandatory when the Secretary violates that detention mandate.   The problem is that the statute does not say anything like that.  The statute says may.  And may does not just suggest discretion, it clearly connotes it.  Opati, 590 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (emphasis in original); see also Jama, 543 U.S., at 346 (That connotation is particularly apt where, as here, may is used in contraposition to the word shall.).  Congresss use of the word may is therefore inconsistent with respondents proposed inference from the statutory structure.  If Congress had intended section 1225(b)(2)(C) to operate as a mandatory cure of any noncompliance with the Governments detention obligations, it would not have conveyed that intention through an unspoken inference in conflict with the unambiguous, express term may.  It would surely instead have coupled that grant of discretion with some indication of its sometimes-mandatory natureperhaps by providing that the Secretary may return certain aliens to Mexico, unless the government fails to comply with its detention obligations, in which case the Secretary must return them.  The statutory grant of discretion here contains no such caveat, and we will not rewrite it to include one.  See id., at 341 (We do not lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply.). The principal dissent emphasizes that section 1225(b)(2)(A) requires detention of all aliens that fall within its terms.  See, e.g., post, at 8 (Alito, J., dissenting) (The language of\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(A) is unequivocal.).  While the Government contests that proposition, we assume arguendo for purposes of this opinion that the dissents interpretation of section 1225(b)(2)(A) is correct, and that the Government is currently violating its obligations under that provision.[5]  Even so, the dissents conclusions regarding section 1225(b)(2)(C) do not follow.  Under the actual text of the statute, Justice Alitos interpretation is practically self-refuting.  He emphasizes that [s]hall be detained means shall be detained, post, at 9, and criticizes the Governments argument that shall means may, post, at 10.  But the theory works both ways.  Congress conferred contiguous-territory return authority in expressly discretionary terms.  [M]ay return the alien means may return the alien. The desire to redress the Governments purported violation of section 1225(b)(2)(A) does not justify transforming the nature of the authority conferred by section 1225(b)(2)(C).[6] The historical context in which the provision was adopted confirms the plain import of its text.  See, e.g., Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 U.S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 9) (textual analysis confirmed by a wider look at [the statutes] structure and history).  Section 1225(b)(2)(C) was not added to the statute until 1996, in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 302,\n","\n","110Stat.\n","300583more than 90 years after the Immigration Act of 1903 added the shall be detained language that appears in section 1225(b)(2)(A).  And section 1225(b)(2)(C) was enacted in the immediate aftermath of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision that specifically called into question the legality of the contiguous-territory return practice.  Prior to that decision, the longstanding practice of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) had been to require some aliens arriving at land border ports of entry to await their exclusion proceedings in Canada or Mexico.  The BIA noted the lack of any evidence that this is a practice known to Congress and the absence of a supporting regulation.  Inre Sanchez-Avila, 21 I. & N. Dec. 444, 465 (1996) (en banc).  Congress responded mere months later by adding section 1225(b)(2)(C) to IIRIRA and conferring on the Secretary express authority (may) to engage in the very practice that the BIA had questioned.  And INS acknowledged that clarification shortly thereafter, explaining that section 1225(b)(2)(C) and its implementing regulation simply add[] to the statute and regulation a long-standing practice of the Service.  62 Fed. Reg. 445 (1997).  That modest backstory suggests a more humble role for section 1225(b)(2)(C) than as a mandatory safety valve for any alien who is not detained under section 1225(b)(2)(A). In addition to contradicting the statutory text and context, the novelty of respondents interpretation bears mention.  Since IIRIRAs enactment 26 years ago, every Presidential administration has interpreted section 1225(b)(2)(C) as purely discretionary.  Indeed, at the time of IIRIRAs enactment and in the decades since, congressional funding has consistently fallen well short of the amount needed to detain all land-arriving inadmissible aliens at the border, yet no administration has ever used section 1225(b)(2)(C) to return all such aliens that it could not otherwise detain. And the foreign affairs consequences of mandating the exercise of contiguous-territory return likewise confirm that the Court of Appeals erred.  Article II of the Constitution authorizes the Executive to engag[e] in direct diplomacy with foreign heads of state and their ministers.  Zivotofsky v. Kerry,\n","\n","576 U.S. 1, 14 (2015).  Accordingly, the Court has taken care to avoid the danger of unwarranted judicial interference in the conduct of foreign policy, and declined to run interference in [the] delicate field of international relations without the affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed.  Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.,\n","\n","569 U.S. 108, 115116 (2013).  That is no less true in the context of immigration law, where [t]he dynamic nature of relations with other countries requires the Executive Branch to ensure that enforcement policies are consistent with this Nations foreign policy.  Arizona v. United States,\n","\n","567 U.S. 387, 397 (2012). By interpreting section 1225(b)(2)(C) as a mandate, the Court of Appeals imposed a significant burden upon the Executives ability to conduct diplomatic relations with Mexico.  MPP applies exclusively to non-Mexican nationals who have arrived at ports of entry that are located in the United States.  1225(a)(1).  The Executive therefore cannot unilaterally return these migrants to Mexico.  In attempting to rescind MPP, the Secretary emphasized that [e]fforts to implement MPP have played a particularly outsized role in diplomatic engagements with Mexico, diverting attention from more productive efforts to fight transnational criminal and smuggling networks and address the root causes of migration.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 262a.  Yet under the Court of Appeals interpretation, section 1225(b)(2)(C) authorized the District Court to force the Executive to the bargaining table with Mexico, over a policy that both countries wish to terminate, and to supervise its continuing negotiations with Mexico to ensure that they are conducted in good faith.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 857 (emphasis deleted).  That stark consequence confirms our conclusion that Congress did not intend section 1225(b)(2)(C) to tie the hands of the Executive in this manner. Finally, we note thatas DHS explained in its October 29 Memorandathe INA expressly authorizes DHS to process applicants for admission under a third option: parole.  See\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A).  Every administration, including the Trump and Biden administrations, has utilized this authority to some extent.  Importantly, the authority is not unbounded: DHS may exercise its discretion to parole applicants only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.  Ibid.  And under the APA, DHSs exercise of discretion within that statutory framework must be reasonable and reasonably explained.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,\n","\n","463 U.S. 29 (1983).  But the availability of the parole option additionally makes clear that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the INA required the Government to continue implementing MPP. In sum, the contiguous-territory return authority in section 1225(b)(2)(C) is discretionaryand remains discretionary notwithstanding any violation of section 1225(b)(2)(A).  To reiterate: we need not and do not resolve the parties arguments regarding whether section 1225(b)(2)(A) must be read in light of traditional principles of law enforcement discretion, and whether the Government is lawfully exercising its parole authorities pursuant to sections 1182(d)(5) and 1226(a).  We merely hold that section 1225(b)(2)(C) means what it says: may means may, and the INA itself does not require the Secretary to continue exercising his discretionary authority under these circumstances. IV The Court of Appeals also erred in holding that [t]he October 29 Memoranda did not constitute a new and separately reviewable final agency action.  20 F. 4th, at 951.  To recap, the Secretary first attempted to terminate MPP through the June 1 Memorandum.  As the Court of Appeals correctly held, that constituted final agency action.  See id., at 947 (citing Bennett v. Spear,\n","\n","520 U.S. 154 (1997)).  But the District Court found that the Secretarys stated grounds in the June 1 Memorandum were inadequate, and therefore vacated the June 1 Memorandum and remanded [the matter] to DHS for further consideration.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 857. As we explained two Terms ago in Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. ___ (2020), upon finding that the grounds for agency action are inadequate, a court may remand for the agency to do one of two things.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  First, the agency can offer a fuller explanation of the agencys reasoning at the time of the agency action.  Ibid. (emphasis deleted).  If it chooses this route, the agency may elaborate on its initial reasons for taking the action, but may not provide new ones.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  Alternatively, the agency can deal with the problem afresh by taking new agency action.  Ibid. (quoting SEC v. Chenery Corp.,\n","\n","332 U.S. 194, 201 (1947) (Chenery II)).  An agency taking this route is not limited to its prior reasons.  Regents, 591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 14). Here, perhaps in light of this Courts previous determination that the Government had failed to show a likelihood of success on the claim that the [June 1 Memorandum] was not arbitrary and capricious, 594 U.S. ___, the Secretary selected the second option from Regents: He accepted the District Courts vacatur and dealt with the problem afresh.  The October 29 Memoranda made that clear by its own terms, Regents, 591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 14), in which the Secretary stated: I am hereby terminating MPP.  Effective immediately, I hereby supersede and rescind the June 1 memorandum.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 263a264a.  And consistent with that approach, the October 29 Memoranda offered several new reasons absent from the June 1 Memorandum, Regents, 591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 14), including an examination of the considerations that the District Court determined were insufficiently addressed in the June 1 memo, App. to Pet. for Cert. 259a. The October 29 Memoranda were therefore final agency action for the same reasons that the June 1 Memorandum was final agency action.  That is, both the June 1 Memorandum and the October 29 Memoranda, when they were issued, mark[ed] the consummation of the agencys decisionmaking process and resulted in rights and obligations [being] determined.  Bennett, 520 U.S., at 178.  As the Court of Appeals explained, the June 1 Memorandum bound DHS staff by forbidding them to continue the program in any way from that moment on.  20 F. 4th, at 947.  That rationale also applies to the October 29 Memoranda, which were therefore final agency action under the APA.[7] The various rationales offered by respondents and the Court of Appeals in support of the contrary conclusion lack merit.[8]  First, the Court of Appeals framed the question by postulating the existence of an agency decision wholly apart from any agency statement of general or particular applicability ... designed to implement that decision.  5    U.S.C. 551(4); see 20 F. 4th, at 950951 (The States are challenging the Termination Decisionnot the June 1 Memorandum, the October 29 Memoranda, or any other memo.).  To the extent that the Court of Appeals understood itself to be reviewing an abstract decision apart from specific agency action, as defined in the APA, that was error.  It was not the case that the June 1 Memorandum and the October 29 Memoranda simply explained DHSs decision, while only the decision itself had legal effect.  Id., at 951.  To the contrary, the June 1 Memorandum and the October 29 Memoranda were themselves the operative agency actions, each of them an agency statement ... designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.\n","\n","5 U.S.C. 551(4). Second, and relatedly, respondents characterized the October 29 Memoranda as posthoc rationalizations of the June 1 Memorandum under our decision in Regents.  Brief for Respondents 40 ([T]he [October 29] Memoranda are nothing more than improper, posthoc rationalizations for terminating MPP.); see also 20 F. 4th, at 961 (questioning how the October 29 Memoranda [could] be anything more than posthoc rationalizations of the Termination Decision).  But Regents involved the exact opposite situation from this one.  There, as here, DHS had attempted to rescind a prior administrations immigration policy, but a District Court found the rescission inadequately explained.  Faced with the same two options outlined above, then- Secretary Nielsen elected the first option rather than the second.  That is, she chose to rest on the [original] Memorandum while elaborating on [her] prior reasoning, rather than issue a new rescission bolstered by new reasons absent from the [original] Memorandum.  591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  As such, her elaboration was limited to the agencys original reasons, and was viewed critically to ensure that the rescission [was] not upheld on the basis of impermissible posthoc rationalization.  Id., at ______ (slip op., at 1415).  And because the then-Secretarys reasoning had little relationship to that of her predecessor, the Court characterized the new explanations as impermissible posthoc rationalizations ... not properly before us.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15). The prohibition on posthoc rationalization applies only when the agency proceeds by the first option from Regents.  Under that circumstance, because the agency has chosen to rest on [its original action] while elaborating on its prior reasoning, id., at ___ (slip op., at 14), the bar on posthoc rationalization operates to ensure that the agencys supplemental explanation is anchored to the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the action, Michigan v. EPA,\n","\n","576 U.S. 743, 758 (2015).  By contrast, as noted above, the Secretary here chose the second option from Regents, and deal[t] with the problem afresh by taking new agency action.  591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  That second option can be more procedurally onerous than the firstthe agency must comply with the procedural requirements for new agency actionbut the benefit is that the agency is not limited to its prior reasons in justifying its decision.  Ibid.  Indeed, the entire purpose of the October 29 Memoranda was for the Secretary to issue a new rescission bolstered by new reasons absent from the [June 1] Memorandum, ibid.reasons that he hoped would answer the District Courts concerns from the first go-round.  Having returned to the drawing table and taken new action, therefore, the Secretary was not subject to the charge of posthoc rationalization. Third, respondents invoke our decision in Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. ___ (2019), to contend that DHSs failure to hew[] to the administrative straight and narrow deprives the October 29 Memoranda of the presumption of regularity that normally attends agency action, Brief for Respondents 43.  As we explained in that case, in reviewing agency action, a court is ordinarily limited to evaluating the agencys contemporaneous explanation in light of the existing administrative record.  Department of Commerce, 588 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 23).  Department of Commerce involved a narrow exception to th[at] general rule that applies where the challengers to the agencys action make a strong showing of bad faith or improper behavior on the part of the agency.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 24) (quoting Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe,\n","\n","401 U.S. 402, 420 (1971)).  We held that exception satisfied by an accumulation of unusual circumstances that demonstrated an explanation for agency action that [was] incongruent with what the record reveal[ed] about the agencys priorities and decisionmaking process.  Department of Commerce, 588 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 28). The circumstances in this case do not come close to those in Department of Commerce.  Nothing in this record suggests a significant mismatch between the decision the Secretary made and the rationale he provided.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 26).  Respondents direct us instead to the Governments litigation conduct.  But the examples of misconduct to which respondents refersuch as a failure to timely complete the administrative record, Brief for Respondents 42have no bearing on the legal status of the October 29 Memoranda.  And in any event, they fall well short of the strong showing of bad faith or improper behavior, Overton Park, 401 U.S., at 420, that we require before deviating from our normal rule that [t]he grounds upon which an administrative order must be judged are those upon which the record discloses that its action was based, SEC v. Chenery Corp.,\n","\n","318 U.S. 80, 87 (1943). The Court of Appeals leveled the related but more modest charge that the Secretary failed to proceed with a sufficiently open mind.  See, e.g., 20 F. 4th, at 955 (agency proceeded without a hint of an intention to put the Termination Decision back on the chopping block and rethink things).  But the agencys ex ante preference for terminating MPPlike any other feature of an administrations policy agendashould not be held against the October 29 Memoranda.  It is hardly improper for an agency head to come into office with policy preferences and ideas ... and work with staff attorneys to substantiate the legal basis for a preferred policy.  Department of Commerce, 588 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 26); see also State Farm, 463 U.S., at 59 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (As long as [an] agency remains within the bounds established by Congress, it is entitled to assess administrative records and evaluate priorities in light of the philosophy of the administration. (footnote omitted)). And the critique is particularly weak on these facts.  The Court of Appeals took the agency to task for its September 29 announcement of its inten[tion] to issue in the coming weeks a new memorandum terminating MPP.  20 F. 4th, at 954; see ibid. (Rather than announcing an intention to reconsider its Termination Decision, the announcement set forth DHSs conclusion in unmistakable terms.).  But that announcement came over six weeks after the District Courts August 13 remanda substantial window of time for the agency to conduct a bona fide reconsideration. More importantly, this Court has previously rejected criticisms of agency closemindedness based on an identity between proposed and final agency action.  See Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 591 U.S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 24) (declin[ing] to evaluate the [agencys] final rules under [an] open-mindedness test where interim and final rules were virtually identical but procedural requirements were otherwise satisfied).  Similar principles refute the Court of Appeals criticism of the October 29 Memoranda for their failure to alter the Termination Decision in any way.  20 F. 4th, at 946.  It is black-letter law that an agency that takes superseding action on remand is entitled to reexamine[] the problem, recast its rationale and reach[] the same result.  Chenery II, 332 U.S., at 196; see also Regents, 591 U.S., at ___ (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (slip op., at 4) (Courts often consider an agencys ... additional explanations made ... on remand from a court, even if the agencys bottom-line decision itself does not change.). Finally, the Court of Appeals erred to the extent it viewed the Governments decision to appeal the District Courts injunction as relevant to the question of the October 29 Memorandas status as final agency action.  Nothing prevents an agency from undertaking new agency action while simultaneously appealing an adverse judgment against its original action.  That is particularly so under the circumstances of this case.  The second condition of the District Courts injunction, which purported to bind DHS to implement MPP in perpetuity subject only to congressional funding choices outside its control, as a practical matter left the Government no choice but to appeal.  And the agency reasonably chose to accede to the District Courts APA analysis of the June 1 Memorandum and seek to ameliorate those concerns in the meantime. *** For the reasons explained, the Governments rescission of MPP did not violate section 1225 of the INA, and the October 29 Memoranda did constitute final agency action.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  On remand, the District Court should consider in the first instance whether the October 29 Memoranda comply with section 706 of the APA.  See State Farm, 463 U.S., at 4657. It is so ordered. &&& SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21954 _________________ JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, etal., PETITIONERS v. TEXAS, etal. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit [June 30, 2022] Justice Kavanaugh, concurring. I agree with the Court that the District Court had jurisdiction over Texass suit.  I also agree with the Court that the Government prevails on the merits of the two specific legal questions presented here. I note, moreover, that six Members of the Court agree with the Courts merits conclusion.  See post, at 1 (Barrett, J., dissenting).   I write separately to briefly elaborate on my understanding of the relevant statutory provisions and to point out one legal issue that remains open for resolution on remand. When the Department of Homeland Security lacks sufficient capacity to detain noncitizens at the southern border pending their immigration proceedings (often asylum proceedings), the immigration laws afford DHS two primary options. Option one:  DHS may grant noncitizens parole into the United States if parole provides a significant public benefit.\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A). Parole entails releasing individuals on a case-by-case basis into the United States subject to reasonable assurances that they will appear at all hearings.  8 CFR 212.5(d) (2020); see\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A).  Notably, every Administration beginning in the late 1990s has relied heavily on the parole option, including the administrations of Presidents Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, 4954. Option two:  DHS may choose to return noncitizens to Mexico.\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C).  Consistent with that statutory authority, the prior Administration chose to return a relatively small group of noncitizens to Mexico.   In general, when there is insufficient detention capacity, both the parole option and the return-to-Mexico option are legally permissible options under the immigration statutes.  As the recent history illustrates, every President since the late 1990s has employed the parole option, and President Trump also employed the return-to-Mexico option for a relatively small group of noncitizens.  Because the immigration statutes afford substantial discretion to the Executive, different Presidents may exercise that discretion differently.  That is Administrative Law 101.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,\n","\n","463 U.S. 29, 59 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).   To be sure, the Administrative Procedure Act and this Courts decision in State Farm require that an executive agencys exercise of discretion be reasonable and reasonably explained.  See id., at 43 (majority opinion); see also FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. ___, ______, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 78, 11); FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.,\n","\n","556 U.S. 502, 514515 (2009);\n","\n","5 U.S.C. 706.  For example, when there is insufficient detention capacity and DHS chooses to parole noncitizens into the United States rather than returning them to Mexico, DHS must reasonably explain why parole provides a significant public benefit.\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A); see, e.g., State Farm, 463 U.S., at 4657.  Review under that State Farm standard is deferential but not toothless.  Id., at 56.  The question of whether DHSs October 29 decision satisfies the State Farm standard is not before this Court at this time.  The Court today therefore properly leaves the State Farm issue for consideration on remand.  See ante, at 18, 25; Tr. of Oral Arg. 6768. To be clear, when there is insufficient detention capacity and the President chooses the parole option because he determines that returning noncitizens to Mexico is not feasible for foreign-policy reasons, a court applying State Farm must be deferential to the Presidents Article II foreign-policy judgment.  Cf., e.g., Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. ___, ______ (2018) (slip op., at 1015).  Nothing in the relevant immigration statutes at issue here suggests that Congress wanted the Federal Judiciary to improperly second-guess the Presidents Article II judgment with respect to American foreign policy and foreign relations.  See Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,\n","\n","343 U.S. 579, 635637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring); see also Dames & Moore v. Regan,\n","\n","453 U.S. 654, 678679, 686688 (1981). One final note:  The larger policy story behind this case is the multi-decade inability of the political branches to provide DHS with sufficient facilities to detain noncitizens who seek to enter the United States pending their immigration proceedings.  But this Court has authority to address only the legal issues before us.  We do not have authority to end the legislative stalemate or to resolve the underlying policy problems.  With those additional comments, I join the Courts opinion in full. &&& SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21954 _________________ JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, etal., PETITIONERS v. TEXAS, etal. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit [June 30, 2022] Justice Barrett, with whom Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, and Justice Gorsuch join as to all but the first sentence, dissenting. I agree with the Courts analysis of the meritsbut not with its decision to reach them.  The lower courts in this case concluded that\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1252(f)(1), a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act sharply limiting federal courts jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of certain immigration laws, did not present a jurisdictional bar.  Just two weeks ago, however, we repudiated their reasoning in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. ___ (2022).  Because we are a court of review and not first view, I would vacate and remand for the lower courts to reconsider their assertion of jurisdiction in light of Aleman Gonzalez. *** Section 1252(f)(1) provides that no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of specified immigration provisions, except as applied to an individual alien against whom proceedings under [those provisions] have been initiated.  Some lower courts have narrowly interpreted this provision, holding that it does not bar relief that a plaintiff frames as requir[ing] (rather than preventing) the Governments enforcement of or compliance with the covered immigration laws.  E.g., 20 F.4th 928, 1004 (CA5 2021).  In this case, that was the only ground pressed by respondents below and relied on by the lower courts to hold that 1252(f)(1) did not ba[r] jurisdiction.  Ibid.; see App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a; Brief for Appellees in No. 2110806 (CA5), pp.4041.  But we just rejected this interpretation in Aleman Gonzalez.  There, we held that 1252(f)(1) deprives lower courts of jurisdiction to entertain requests for injunctions that order federal officials to take or to refrain from taking actions to enforce, implement, or otherwise carry out the specified statutory provisions (subject to an exception, indisputably inapplicable to this case, for a suit by an individual noncitizen in proceedings under those provisions).  596 U.S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 1, 5). In the normal course, we would vacate and remand this case for further proceedings in light of Aleman Gonzalez.  Instead, the Court plows ahead to break new jurisdictional ground.  Acting on a compressed timeline, it embraces a theory of 1252(f)(1) thatso far as I can tellno court of appeals has ever adopted: that 1252(f)(1) limits only the lower courts remedial authority, not their subject-matter jurisdiction.  The only court of appeals to have addressed this theory rejected it.  Miranda v. Garland, 34 F.4th 338, 354356 (CA4 2022).  Still, the Court is confident enough to proceed based on short, barely adversarial supplemental briefs.  (The United States original brief devoted only a conclusory footnote to the jurisdictional question, and Texas and Missouri did not respond.)  And these supplemental briefs are particularly unhelpful because, having been submitted prior to our decision in Aleman Gonzalez, they could not address that decisions significance for this case.  In fact, they devoted a considerable portion of their allotted length to the issue that Aleman Gonzalez subsequently resolved. This would all matter less if the jurisdictional question were easy or unimportantbut it is neither.  The Courts opinion papers over difficult issues, as I will discuss below, and its jurisdictional holding is likely to affect many cases.  See, e.g., Texas v. Biden, ___ F.Supp. 3d ___, ___, 2022 WL 658579, *14 (ND Tex., Mar. 4, 2022) (1252(f)(1) does not bar Texas claim that the Federal Government is wrongly refusing to detain noncitizens to determine if they have COVID19); Defendants Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion for Temporary Restraining Order 89 in Arizona v. CDC, Civ. No. 6:22cv00885 (WD La., Apr. 22, 2022) (arguing that 1252(f)(1) prohibits a district court from constraining the Federal Governments removal discretion in litigation challenging termination of Title 42 order).  We should not short circuit the ordinary process. I have several doubts about the Courts analysis of 1252(f)(1).  To begin with, the Court assumes that we face an either/or choice between subject-matter jurisdiction and remedial authority, with the former being only about a courts authority to decide merits questions and the latter being only about the relief a court can grant.  Ante, at 9.  This dichotomy makes the Courts job easier, because it can use the obvious point that 1252(f)(1) strips lower courts of remedial authority to establish that 1252(f)(1) does not strip them of subject-matter jurisdiction.  But why is it a binary choice?  I would think that Congress is free to link a courts subject-matter jurisdiction to its remedial authority.  That is not so different from an amount-in-controversy requirement, which conditions a district courts ability to address the merits on the relief that the plaintiff seeks.  See, e.g.,\n","\n","28 U.S.C. 1332 (district courts have subject-matter jurisdiction over diversity cases only when the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000).  And the redressability requirement of Article III itself establishes a tie between jurisdiction and remedies, because a courts inability to order effective relief deprives it of jurisdiction to decide the merits of a question otherwise within its competence.  See, e.g., California v. Texas, 593 U.S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 7) (redressability consider[s] the relationship between the judicial relief requested and the injury suffered); Los Angeles v. Lyons,\n","\n","461 U.S. 95, 105107 (1983) (failure to allege sufficient likelihood of future injury deprives a federal court of Article III jurisdiction to entertain [the count] of the complaint seeking injunctive relief). So it seems to me quite possible that 1252(f)(1) withdraws subject-matter jurisdiction over cases seeking certain remedies.  Indeed, while the Government has a theory for why the Court can reach the merits in this case, it characterizes 1252(f)(1) as imposing jurisdictional limitations that speak to a courts power and can never be forfeited or waived.  Supplemental Brief for Petitioners 1920; see also Miranda, 34 F.4th, at 354 (concluding that 1252(f)(1) is a jurisdiction-stripping statute that cannot be waived).  If there is a reason to treat limitations on  subject-matter jurisdiction and limitations on remedial authority as mutually exclusiveeither in general or in this statutory schemethe Court does not explain it. The Court breezes past other questions too.  Most notably, it gives surprisingly little attention to a phrase on which it places significant weight: 1252(f)(1)s parenthetical exempting the Supreme Court from its general bar on jurisdiction or authority.  The parties hardly discuss this parenthetical, which does not appear to have an analogue elsewhere in the United States Code.  The Court, however, takes the phrase as conclusive evidence that 1252(f)(1) does not deprive district courts of subject- matter jurisdiction over non-individual claims under [the covered provisions], because if it did, no such claims could ever arrive at this Court, rendering the provisions specific carveout for Supreme Court injunctive relief nugatory.  Ante, at 10. While this interpretation has some surface appeal, the Court does not explain how it would work.  Does it mean that the restriction on remedial authority is subject to waiver or forfeiture, so that a lower court can sometimes properly enter non-individual injunctive relief that this Court can then review?  That a district court has the authority to enter some kinds of non-individual relief (for example, a classwide declaratory judgment) and that this Court can enter different relief (for example, a classwide injunction) on review of that judgment?  Or that this Court can enter an injunction on appeal if the district court could have entered at least one form of relief, even if it actually entered only relief that exceeded its authority?[1]*  Or perhaps the parenthetical serves the very different purpose of clarifying that 1252(f)(1) does not disturb any pre-existing authority this Court has under the All Writs Act or other sources.  These are difficult questions, yet the Court does not address any of them. Indeed, the Court explicitly chooses not to opine on some of the issues that might help explain the parentheticals unusual reservation.  See ante, at 12, n.4.  For example, the Court declines to decide whether the bar in 1252(f)(1) is subject to forfeiture, even though that is a defining feature of nonjurisdictional rules.  See, e.g., Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Servs. of Chicago, 583 U.S. ___, ______ (2017) (slip op., at 23).  It reserves the question whether 1252(f)(1) bars declaratory relief, an issue on which there are conflicting views.  Compare Alli v. Decker, 650 F.3d 1007, 1013 (CA3 2011) (it does not bar declaratory relief), with id., at 10191021 (Fuentes, J., dissenting) (it does), with Hamama v. Adducci, 912 F.3d 869, 880, n.8 (CA6 2018) (it depends).  And it avoids a position on whether 1252(f)(1) prevents a lower court from vacating or setting aside an agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act.  See\n","\n","5 U.S.C. 706(2).  Not that I fault the Court for holding back.  Quite the contrary: The questions surrounding 1252(f)(1) are complex and deserve more attention than we can give them in this posture. As a final touch, the Court asserts that our precedent has already charted this course.  Ante, at 1112.  But the Court cannot muster much on that front.  It cites a passing statement rejecting an inapposite argument that 1252(f)(1) is a jurisdictional grant, see Reno v. American-Arab Anti- Discrimination Comm.,\n","\n","525 U.S. 471, 481 (1999), a brief discussion from a plurality opinion in a case where the 1252(f)(1) issue had not been briefed or argued by the parties in this Court, see Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. ___, ______ (2019) (slip op., at 89), and a dissent, see Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S ___, ___ (2018) (opinion of Breyer, J.) (slip op., at 31).  None provides a clear roadmap for this case. *** Given all this, I would tread more carefully.  We should let the lower courts be the first to address the substantial antecedent questions that 1252(f)(1) presents in light of our hot-off-the-presses decision in Aleman Gonzalez.  I respectfully dissent. &&& SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21954 _________________ JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, etal., PETITIONERS v. TEXAS, etal. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit [June 30, 2022] Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch join, dissenting. In fiscal year 2021, the Border Patrol reported more than 1.7 million encounters with aliens along the Mexican border.[1]  When it appears that one of these aliens is not admissible, may the Government simply release the alien in this country and hope that the alien will show up for the hearing at which his or her entitlement to remain will be decided? Congress has provided a clear answer to that question, and the answer is no.  By law, if an alien is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a [removal] proceeding.\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added).  And if an alien asserts a credible fear of persecution, he or she shall be detained for further consideration of the application for asylum, 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).  Those requirements, as we have held, are mandatory.  See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 13). Congress offered the Executive twoand only twoalternatives to detention.  First, if an alien is arriving on land from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may return the alien to that territory pending a [removal] proceeding.  1225(b)(2)(C).  Second, DHS may release individual aliens on parole, but only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit.  1182(d)(5)(A). Due to the huge numbers of aliens who attempt to enter illegally from Mexico, DHS does not have the capacity to detain all inadmissible aliens encountered at the border, and no one suggests that DHS must do the impossible.  But rather than avail itself of Congresss clear statutory alternative to return inadmissible aliens to Mexico while they await proceedings in this country, DHS has concluded that it may forgo that option altogether and instead simply release into this country untold numbers of aliens who are very likely to be removed if they show up for their removal hearings.  This practice violates the clear terms of the law, but the Court looks the other way. In doing so, the majority commits three main errors.  First, it unnecessarily resolves difficult jurisdictional questions on whichdue to the Governments litigation tacticswe have received only hurried briefing and no argument.  Second, when the majority reaches the merits, it contrives a way to overlook the clear statutory violations that result from DHSs decision to terminate the use of its contiguous-territory return authority.  Finally, the majority unjustifiably faults the Court of Appeals for rejecting the Governments last-minute attempt to derail the ordinary appellate process.  I cannot go along with any of this, and I therefore respectfully dissent. I In 2018, a surge of foreign migrants attempted to enter the United States unlawfully at the United States-Mexico border, creating a humanitarian and border security crisis.  554 F.Supp. 3d 818, 831 (ND Tex. 2021).  Because existing detention facilities could not house all the people who were attempting to enter unlawfully, many illegal aliens with meritless asylum claims were being released into the United States, and many, once released, simply disappeared. Ibid. (emphasis deleted).  To address this problem, DHS promulgated the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) in December of that year.  See id., at 832.  The MPP program relied on Congresss express grant of authority to return alien[s] ... arriving on land ... from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States to that territory pending a proceeding to remove them to their countries of origin.  1225(b)(2)(C).[2]  MPP provided that certain non-Mexican nationals arriving at the United States border by land from Mexico would be returned to Mexico to await the results of their removal proceedings.  The Mexican Government agreed to cooperate and to accept aliens while they awaited removal. While the policy was in effect, DHS issued a memorandum in which it determined that MPP was an indispensable tool in addressing the ongoing crisis at the southern border. App. 189 (Department of Homeland Security: Assessment of the Migrant Protection Protocols (Oct. 28, 2019)).  It concluded that MPP directly reduced the number of aliens unlawfully released into the United States and deterred others from attempting to cross the border unlawfully in the first place.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 833.  DHS found that total border encounters decreased by 64 percent after MPP was implemented.  App. 189.  With MPP in place, aliens who lacked meritorious claims could no longer count on a free ticket into the United States, and as a result, many voluntarily return[ed] home.  Id., at 192.  MPP also helped DHS process meritorious asylum claims within months, rather than leaving asylum applicants in limbo for years.  Id., at 190. Hours after his inauguration on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order suspending MPP, and the effects on the border were immediate.  According to the Governments own data, border encounters jump[ed] from 75,000 in January 2021, when MPP was first suspended, to about 173,000 in April 2021.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 837. Two States, Texas and Missouri, brought suit under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in April 2021, alleging that suspending MPP was arbitrary and capricious and violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).  The District Court ordered the Government to file the administrative record for the January suspension, and on May 31, 2021, the Government filed a three-line suspension memorandum as the entire administrative record.  See id., at 856, n. 16.  The next day, in a 7-page memo issued by the Secretary, DHS terminated the already-suspended program. The States amended their complaint to challenge the June termination decision on largely the same grounds that they had advanced with respect to the January suspension.  After a consolidated preliminary injunction hearing and a trial on the merits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2), the District Court vacated the Governments decision to rescind MPP and enjoined the Secretary to continue to implement that policy in good faith until all the aliens in question could be detained or lawfully paroled.  Id., at 857.  The Government sought a stay of this order, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, while expediting the Governments appeal, refused to issue a stay.  10 F. 4th 538, 543561 (2021) (percuriam).  The Government then sought a stay in this Court, but we denied that application.  594 U.S. ___ (2021). On September 29, 2021, while briefing in the Court of Appeals was underway, DHS announced that it intended to issue a new memorandum terminating MPP, and the Government asked the Court of Appeals to hold its appeal in abeyance pending this promised administrative action.  App. 5152.  The Court of Appeals denied that motion, id., at 54, and then, two business days before oral argument, DHS issued two memoranda declaring that DHS had made a new decision terminating MPP.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 257a345a.  At the same time, the Government asked the Court of Appeals to hold that the case before it was moot, to vacate the District Courts judgment and injunction, and to remand the case for further proceedings.  20 F. 4th 928, 946 (CA5 2021).  The Fifth Circuit refused and held that the October 29 Memoranda did not moot the appeal or have any other legal effect on the appellate proceedings.  Id., at 956966, 9981000.  The Fifth Circuit then affirmed the District Court on the merits. II I agree with the majority that the injunction entered by the District Court in this case exceeded its jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the relevant statutes.  1252(f)(1).  That conclusion follows from a straightforward analysis of the text of 1252(f)(1), as recognized by the Courts decision in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. ___ (2022).  But that is where the majority and I part ways. I agree with Justice Barrett that the majority should not go any further and should not resolve other questions about 1252(f)(1) without adequate briefing or argument.  The Government admits that this Court could in theory vacate the judgment below without reaching the merits, Supp. Brief for Petitioners 23, but the majority chooses to decide far more than is necessary or advisable under the circumstances. As Justice Barrett explains, the interpretation of 1252(f)(1) presents difficult questions that the parties should have addressed in the briefs they filed before oral argument.  In its opening brief, the Governments only discussion of this issue appeared in a footnote that reads as follows in its entirety: In addition, the lower courts lacked jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief under 8 U.S.C. []1252(f)(1). This Court is considering the scope of Section 1252(f)(1) in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, No. 20322 (argued Jan. 11, 2022).  Brief for Petitioners 18, n. 3. That footnotes reference to the Governments brief in Gonzalez raised an obvious question.  Section 1252(f)(1) refers to orders that enjoin or restrain the operation of specified statutory provisions, and in Gonzalez, the Government suggested that this provision should not be interpreted to apply only to injunctions.  Brief for Petitioners 1719, 32, n. 3, and Tr. of Oral Arg. 1516, in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, O. T. 2021, No. 20322.  Instead, the Government refused to rule out the possibility that the provision might also apply to class-wide declaratory relief, and it analogized 1252(f)(1) to the Tax Injunction Act,\n","\n","28 U.S.C. 1341, and cited our decision in California v. Grace Brethren Church,\n","\n","457 U.S. 393 (1982), which interpreted that provision in a practical sense.  Id., at 408. In the present case, the Government challenged the order of the District Court set[ting] aside under the APA,\n","\n","5 U.S.C. 706(2), the June termination of MPP, and since this order had a practical effect that was in some respects similar to an injunction, the Governments argument in Gonzalez raised the question whether the Government thought that 1252(f)(1) also barred the District Court from reviewing the termination of the MPP under the APA.  That is an important question the resolution of which could have effects extending far beyond this particular dispute, and at oral argument the Solicitor General took the far-reaching position that 1252(f)(1) does indeed bar APA review.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 1314.  But none of the papers filed by the Government in this case or in Gonzalez said one word about APA review.  Nor did the respondents brief.  Indeed, their brief did not discuss jurisdiction at all. Faced with this situation, the Court was correctly concerned about deciding the reach of 1252(f)(1) and the important APA question without any briefing.  The Court could haveand, in my judgment, should havedealt with this problem by deciding this case without saying anything about 1252(f)(1) other than that it bars injunctive relief.  Instead, with the end of the Term looming ahead, the Court directed the parties to brief these issues, but it gave them just one week to do so.  And as the Court should have anticipated, those briefs raised new questions that it would have been useful to explore at argument had that been held.  But determined to accommodate the Governments request that this case be decided this Term, the majority inadvisably plows ahead. I would not do so.  Because of the Governments request for a speedy decision, we established an expedited schedule for the filing of merits briefs and squeezed in oral argument on the next-to-last argument date.  We would have been in a position to give thorough consideration to the 1252(f)(1) issue if it had been addressed in the parties regular briefs, but having relegated the issue to a terse footnote in its brief, and having been unprepared to discuss the issue at argument, the Government is not entitled to any further special treatment.  We should simply vacate the decision below and remand for reconsideration in light of our decision in Gonzalez.[3]  Nothing more is either necessary or appropriate under the circumstances. III The Court is not only wrong to reach the merits of this case, but its analysis of the merits is seriously flawed.  First, the majority errs in holding that the INA does not really mean what it says when it commands that the aliens in question shall be detained pending removal or asylum proceedings unless they are either returned to Mexico or paroled on a case-by-case basis.  According to the majority, it is fine for DHS simply to release these aliens en masse and allow them to disappear.  Second, the majority improperly faults the Court of Appeals for refusing to allow the Government to derail the appellate process by a last-minute maneuver designed to thwart review of the manner in which it initially terminated MPP. A As described above, the INA gives DHS three options regarding the treatment of the aliens in question while they await removal or asylum proceedings.  They may be (1) detained in this country or (2) returned to Mexico or (3) paroled on a case-by-case basis.  Congress has provided no fourth option, but the majority now creates one.  According to the majority, an alien who cannot be detained due to a shortage of detention facilities but could be returned to Mexico may simply be released.  That is wrong. 1 The language of\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(A) is unequivocal.  With narrow exceptions that are inapplicable here,[4] it provides that every alien who is an applicant for admission and who the examining immigration officer determines ... is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted ... shall be detained for a [removal] proceeding.  (Emphasis added.)  Six years ago, the Government argued strenuously that this requirement is mandatory, and its brief could hardly have been more categorical or emphatic in making this point.  See Brief for Petitioners in Jennings v. Rodriguez, O. T. 2017, No. 151204, p. 15 (Aliens seeking admission who are not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted are statutorily prohibited from physically entering the United States and must be detained during removal proceedings ... , unless the Secretary exercises his discretion to release them on parole); id., at 17 (Unlike the word may, which implies discretion, the word shall usually connotes a requirement.  And here, the repeated shall be detained clearly means what it says (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). The Jennings Court correctly accepted that argument, which was central to our holding.  See 583 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (Read most naturally, 1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) thus mandate detention of applicants for admission until certain proceedings have concluded).  But now, in an about-face, the Government argues that shall be detained actually means may be detained.  See Brief for Petitioners 29 ([T]he Court will not construe a provision stating that law enforcement shall take some action as a true mandate absent some stronger indication from the ... Legislature). The Government was correct in Jennings and is wrong here.  [S]hall be detained means shall be detained.  The Government points out that it lacks the facilities to detain all the aliens in question, and no one questions that fact.  But use of the contiguous-return authority would at least reduce the number of aliens who are released in violation of the INAs command.  The District Court made a factual finding that rescinding MPP would cause additional violations of Congresss unambiguous detention mandate.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 851852.  It also found that the termination of MPP has contributed to the current border surge by giving aliens the perverse incentiv[e], id., at 837, App. 196, to cross the border illegally in hopes of being paroled and released.  Id., at 79.  Thus, the Government is failing to meet the statutory detention mandate, not only because of limitations on its detention capacity but also because it refuses to use the contiguous-territory return authority. Other than the argument that shall means may, the Governments only other textual argument is that it is paroling aliens on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit, as permitted under 1182(d)(5)(A).  But the number of aliens paroled each month under that provisionmore than 27,000 in April of this year[5]gives rise to a strong inference that the Government is not really making these decisions on a case-by-case basis.  The Government argues that respondents had the burden to show that it is not making case-by-case determinations and that they have not met that burden, see Brief for Petitioners 34, but information about the true nature of these proceedings is in the Governments possession, and it has revealed little about what actually takes place.  At argument, however, the Solicitor General argued that the case-by-case determination requirement can be met simply by going through a brief checklist for each alien.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5860.  Even the rudimentary step of verifying that an alien does not have a criminal record is not performed in every case.  Id., at 31.  Such procedures are inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of case-by-case review, and as the Court of Appeals pointed out, the circumstances under which 1182(d)(5)(B)) was adopted bolster that conclusion.  See 20 F. 4th, at 947 (After the executive branch on multiple occasions purported to use the parole power to bring in large groups of immigrants, Congress twice amended\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5) to limit the scope of the parole power and prevent the executive branch from using it as a programmatic policy tool (citing T. Aleinikoff etal., Immigration and Citizenship: Process and Policy 300 (9th ed. 2021))). The majority claims that the Governments use of its parole authority under 1182(d)(5)(A) is not before us, ante, at 18, but the Government cites that authority as a reason why it does not need to use its contiguous-territory return authority.  Brief for Petitioners 6, 3336. Moreover, the District Courts judgment relied on factual findings regarding DHSs abuse of its parole authority on the record that the Government provided.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 837. For these reasons, 1182(d)(5)(A) cannot justify the release of tens of thousands of apparently inadmissible aliens each month, and that leaves the Government with only one lawful option: continue to return inadmissible aliens to Mexico.  See 1225(b)(2)(C). 2 The majoritys chief defense of the Governments rejection of MPP is based on a blinkered method of statutory interpretation that we have firmly rejected.  The majority largely ignores the mandatory detention requirement imposed by 1225(b)(2)(A) and, instead, reads the contiguous-return provision, 1225(b)(2)(C), in isolation.  That provision says that the Secretary may return aliens to the country from which they entered, not that the Secretary must do so, and for the majority, that is enough to show that use of that authority is not required. That reading ignores the statutory structure of the INA, ante, at 14, and wrongly confine[s] itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation.  FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,\n","\n","529 U.S. 120, 132 (2000).  We have an obligation to read the INA as a coherent regulatory scheme.  Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,\n","\n","513 U.S. 561, 569 (1995); see also FTC v. Mandel Brothers, Inc.,\n","\n","359 U.S. 385, 389 (1959); Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U.S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 10); A. Scalia & G. Garner, Reading Law 180 (2012) (describing the harmonious-reading canon).  And if we follow that canon, the majoritys interpretation collapses. Read as a whole, the INA gives DHS discretion to choose from among only three options for handling the relevant category of inadmissible aliens.  The Government must either: (1) detain them, (2) return them to a contiguous foreign nation, or (3) parole them into the United States on an individualized, case-by-case basis.  These options operate in a hydraulic relationship: When it is not possible for the Government to comply with the statutory mandate to detain inadmissible aliens pending further proceedings, it must resort to one or both of the other two options in order to comply with the detention requirement to the greatest extent possible. There is nothing strange about this interpretation of how the relevant provisions of the INA work together.  Consider this example.  Suppose a state law provides that every school district shall provide a free public education to every student from kindergarten through the 12th grade and that another statute says that a district may arrange for its students to attend high school in an adjacent district.  A small district refuses to operate its own high school because it lacks the necessary funds, and this district also declines to arrange for its students to attend a school in an adjacent district because the law says only that a district may take that course of action.  Refusing to exercise this discretionary authority, the district throws up its hands and says to its high school students: Were sorry.  If you want to go to high school, you will have to make your own arrangements and foot the bill.  If those students sue, would any court sustain what the district did? Other examples come readily to mind.  Suppose that a building code says that every multi-unit residential building shall have at least two means of egress from upper floors, and suppose that another provision says that such a building may have an external fire escape.  The owner of such a building refuses to construct a second internal stairway because the cost would be prohibitive and also declines to install a fire escape because the law says that option is discretionary.  Would the owners non-compliance be permitted? Here is one more example.  A State that operates its own motor vehicle inspection facilities has a law that says that every vehicle shall be inspected every year.  The law also says that motorists may have their vehicles inspected at a licensed private garage.  A motorist fails to have his car inspected because he must work during the time when the state facility is open and would be fired if he took time off.  This motorist also declines to have his car inspected at a private garage that is open during his off hours because the law says only that he may use such a facility.  Would the motorist escape a citation? The answer in each of the above examples is that the failure to make use of the discretionary option would not be seen as a valid excuse for non-compliance with the command that certain conduct shall be performed, and it is also hard to see the difference between those examples and the situation here. 3 The majoritys main reason for rejecting the argument just described is that the contiguous-return provision does not say expressly that it was meant to operate as a mandatory cure of any non-compliance with the Governments detention obligations.  Ante, at 14.  But what logic compels need not be stated expressly. The majority also relies on the fact that the contiguous- return provision was enacted 90 years after the provision requiring detention and the fact that the circumstances under which the contiguous-return provision was adopted suggest that it was intended to serve only a humble role.  Ante, at 16.  Those circumstances cannot change what the relevant provisions say or the way in which they logically work together.  See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc.,\n","\n","545 U.S. 546, 568 (2005) (Extrinsic materials have a role in statutory interpretation only to the extent that they shed a reliable light on the enacting Legislatures understanding of otherwise ambiguous terms).  The Court should not use extra-textual evidence to demote one of DHSs three lawful alternatives to the status of a historical footnote. The majority and the concurrence fault the lower courts for intruding upon the foreign policy authority conferred on the President by Article II of the Constitution.  Ante, at 1617 (majority opinion); ante, at 3 (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.).  But enforcement of immigration laws often has foreign relations implications, and the Constitution gives Congress broad authority to set immigration policy.  See Art. I, 8, cl. 4.  This means, we have said, that [p]olicies pertaining to the entry of aliens are entrusted exclusively to Congress.  Galvan v. Press,\n","\n","347 U.S. 522, 531 (1954) (emphasis added).  The President has vital power in the field of foreign affairs, so does Congress, and the President does not have the authority to override immigration laws enacted by Congress.  Indeed, [w]hen the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter.  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,\n","\n","343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).  And it is Congress, not the Judiciary, that gave the Executive only three options for dealing with inadmissible aliens encountered at the border. Finally, the majority emphasizes the fact that prior administrations have also failed to detain inadmissible aliens, but that practice does not change what the law demands.  The majority cites no authority for the doctrine that the Executive can acquire authority forbidden by law through a process akin to adverse possession. B Not only does the majority fail to heed the clear language of the INA, but it gratuitously faults the Court of Appeals for what appears to be a fairly modest and correct conclusion: that the October 29 Memoranda purporting to re-terminate MPP did not ultimately affect the merits of the appeal of the judgment that was before that court.  The Government issued its October 29 Memoranda after briefing in the Court of Appeals had been completed and only days before the appeal was set to be argued.  Based on those memoranda, the Government asked the Court of Appeals to vacate the judgment below, but it did not provide a full administrative record or give the District Court an opportunity to review the purported new decision in the first instance by filing a Rule 60(b) motion.[6]  The majority now says that the Court of Appeals erred by failing to treat the October 29 Memoranda as a new, final agency action, but the majority does not say what applying that label would have required the Fifth Circuit to do differently. As I see it, the Governments litigation tacticfiling the October 29 Memoranda with a suggestion of mootness but without seeking to dismiss its appealcould have triggered one of four responses from the Court of Appeals.  The Court of Appeals could have (1) dismissed the appeal as moot and vacated the District Courts judgment and injunction; (2) held the appeal in abeyance for an unspecified time; (3) evaluated the October 29 Memoranda as final agency action in the first instance under the APA; or (4) concluded that the October 29 Memoranda did not affect the appeal, which challenged the June termination.  The Court of Appeals picked the fourth option, and taking each option in turn, I will explain why that was the response best suited to avoid derailing the ordinary appellate process. First, the October 29 Memoranda did not moot the appeal.  A case becomes moot only if it is impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief.  Chafin v. Chafin,\n","\n","568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013).  Under this high standard, the Fifth Circuit was correct that the case was not moot.  Although the Government claimed that the appeal was moot, it asked the Court of Appeals for relief, namely, vacatur of District Courts injunction.  It was compelled to take that position because the October 29 Memoranda, by their own terms, did not take effect as long as that injunction remained in force.  See 20 F. 4th, at 957.  And without an appellate decision holding that the INA allows the Government to release aliens who could be returned to Mexico, the issuance of a new administrative order terminating MPP could not provide a ground for vacating the injunction.  It is telling that the Governments briefing in this Court never suggests that the case was moot at the time of the Fifth Circuits decision or that the case is now moot. Second, the Court of Appeals did not err by declining to hold the appeal in abeyance.  The Government originally asked the Court of Appeals to hold the appeal while it completed the process of issuing a new termination decision, but by the time of oral argument in that court, the Government claimed that such a decision had been issued.  And the Government did not file a motion in the District Court to vacate its judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b).  The Government had sought to expedite proceedings at every stage, including by seeking emergency relief in the Fifth Circuit and this Court, and under these circumstances, it was eminently reasonable for the Court of Appeals to conclude that additional delay would not have served the interests of economy of time and effort.  Landis v. North American Co.,\n","\n","299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936). Third, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the October 29 Memoranda could not satisfy our criteria for a final agency action that could be reviewed in the first instance in the Court of Appeals under the APA.  Like this Court, the courts of appeal are courts of review, and not first view.  City of Austin v. Reagan Nat. Advertising of Austin, LLC, 596 U.S. ___, ______ (2022) (slip op., at 1314) (quoting Zivotofsky v. Clinton,\n","\n","566 U.S. 189, 201 (2012)).  With no administrative record for the October 29 Memoranda before it, the Court of Appeals was in a poor position to assess whether the memoranda actually mark[ed] the consummation of the agencys decisionmaking process, Bennett v. Spear,\n","\n","520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Moreover, the October 29 Memoranda did not purport to result in a final determination of rights or obligations.  Ibid.  As DHS acknowledged, the termination of MPP could not be implemented until there was a final judicial decision to vacate the ... injunction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 264a, 270a.  And until that was accomplished, the memoranda did not impose on DHS officers or employees any obligatio[n] to cease implementation of MPP.  Bennett, 520 U.S., at 178.  On this basis, the Fifth Circuit rightly understood that the October 29 Memoranda could have no legal effect while DHS was bound by an injunction to implement MPP in good faith and that this injunction would remain in force unless the Governments challenge to the June termination was decided in its favor.[7] Even if the Fifth Circuit had somehow concluded that the October 29 Memoranda constituted final agency action with some future legal consequences, the Court does not explain what the Fifth Circuit should have done differently in the circumstances it faced.  The Fifth Circuit had little ability to review whether the agency had acted reasonably.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,\n","\n","463 U.S. 29 (1983).  And the Fifth Circuit provided a reasonable explanation for its actions. With these three options off the table, the Fifth Circuit reasonably chose the fourth option.  It correctly concluded that the October 29 Memoranda did not affect its ability to review the District Court judgment.  To find fault with proceeding in that fashion, the majority seems to assume that an administrative agency may obviate a district court decision setting aside agency action under 706 of the APA by pursing the following course of conduct: first, appeal the district court decision; second, take a purportedly new action that achieves the same result as the one previously set aside; and third, while declining to seek vacatur of the earlier judgment in the district court, ask the court of appeals to vacate that judgment without reviewing its correctness or the lawfulness of the second action.  The Court of Appeals was correct to view this as an effort to thwart the normal appellate process. *** While I would affirm the Fifth Circuit if we reached the merits, I agree with the majority that the District Court on remand should consider in the first instance whether the October 29 Memoranda complied with 706 of the APA.  The District Court should assess, among other things, whether it is arbitrary and capricious for DHS to refuse to use its contiguous-territory return authority to avoid violations of the statutes clear detention mandate; whether the deterrent effect that DHS found MPP produced in reducing dangerous attempted illegal border crossings, as well as MPPs reduction of unmeritorious asylum claims, is adequately accounted for in the agencys new decision; and whether DHSs rescission of MPP is causing it to make parole decisions on an unlawful categorical basis rather than case-by-case, as the statute prescribes.\n","\n","tokenized_text: tensor([[21603,    10, 17173,  ...,  5408,  5197,     1]]) 4096\n","\n","summary_ids: tensor([[    0,     3,    15,  2234,     3,    40,    23,    76,    10,  1614,\n","             3,    49,  1271,    16,  3609,    24,     3,    52,  1579,   159,\n","          1938,    13,   283,  6158, 15108,    26,     3, 21116,     6,     3,\n","         23649,     3,     5,     3,    40,    23,    76,    10,     3,    99,\n","             3, 21116, 12871,    26, 13488,    20,  9174,     6,   258,    34,\n","            47,    59,     3,     9,   804,  3193,  1041,     3,     5,     3,\n","            88,   845,     3,     9,    26,     3, 24344, 12226,  1707,    13,\n","          1357,    19,    59,  2193,    12,     3,    52,  1579,   159,  1938,\n","            13,  1291,     3,     5,     3,    40,    23,    76,    10,     3,\n","            99,     3,    52,  1579,   159,  1938,    13,  1291, 15108,    26,\n","             3, 21116,     6,   258,    34,    47,    59,   804,  3193,  1041,\n","             3,     5,     1]]) 113\n","\n","pred: eric liu: court erred in holding that rescission of MPP violated INA, APA. liu: if INA mandated mandatory detention, then it was not a final agency action. he says ad hoc rationalization of decision is not relevant to rescission of policy. liu: if rescission of policy violated INA, then it was not final agency action. 319\n","\n"]}],"source":["max_input_length = max(task1_df['len_Justia_txt']) # 362588\n","max_target_length = max(task1_df['len_Justia_summary']) # 3445\n","input = task1_df_v2.loc[1, 'document']\n","print('input:', input)\n","print()\n","\n","tokenized_text = tokenizer.encode(('summarize: '+ input), max_length=4096, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n","print('tokenized_text:', tokenized_text, len(tokenized_text[0]))\n","print()\n","\n","summary_ids = model.generate(tokenized_text, max_length=4096)\n","print('summary_ids:', summary_ids, len(summary_ids[0]))\n","print()\n","\n","pred = tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n","print('pred:', pred, len(pred))\n","print()"],"id":"12_K_BvzmgRK"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":143},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":408,"status":"ok","timestamp":1664854887221,"user":{"displayName":"Yoon Tae Park","userId":"09999553679903486983"},"user_tz":240},"id":"A7kcf815oT9T","outputId":"0395fba9-b99a-4bc7-8aca-a37b12e1c7d5"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'In 2019, the Department of Homeland Security implemented the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP): certain non-Mexican nationals arriving by land from Mexico were returned to Mexico to await the results of their removal proceedings.

Detroit Timber & Lumber Co.,\n","200 U.S. 321, 337. SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus biden etal. v. texas etal. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit No. 21954.Argued April 26, 2022Decided June 30, 2022 In January 2019, the Department of Homeland Security began to implement the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).  Under MPP, certain non-Mexican nationals arriving by land from Mexico were returned to Mexico to await the results of their removal proceedings under section 1229a of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).  MPP was implemented pursuant to a provision of the INA that applies to aliens arriving on land . . . from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States and provides that the Secretary of Homeland Security may return the alien to that territory pending a proceeding under section 1229a.\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C).  Following a change in Presidential administrations, the Biden administration announced that it would suspend the program, and on June 1, 2021, the Secretary of Homeland Security issued a memorandum officially terminating it.  The States of Texas and Missouri (respondents) brought suit in the Northern District of Texas against the Secretary and others, asserting that the June 1 Memorandum violated the INA and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  The District Court entered judgment for respondents.  The court first concluded that terminating MPP would violate the INA, reasoning that section 1225 of the INA provides the government two options with respect to illegal entrants: mandatory detention pursuant to section 1225(b)(2)(A) or contiguous-territory return pursuant to section 1225(b)(2)(C).  554 F.Supp. 3d 818, 852.  Because the Government was unable to meet its mandatory detention obligations under section 1225(b)(2)(A) due to resource constraints, the court reasoned, terminating MPP would necessarily lead to the systemic violation of section 1225 as illegal entrants were released into the United States.  Second, the District Court concluded that the June 1 Memorandum was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.  The District Court vacated the June 1 Memorandum and remanded to DHS.  It also imposed a nationwide injunction ordering the Government to enforce and implement MPP in good faith until such a time as it has been lawfully rescinded in compliance with the APA and until such a time as the federal government has sufficient detention capacity to detain all aliens subject to mandatory detention under [section 1225] without releasing any aliens because of a lack of detention resources.  Id., at 857 (emphasis in original). While the Governments appeal was pending, the Secretary released the October 29 Memoranda, which again announced the termination of MPP and explained anew his reasons for doing so.  The Government then moved to vacate the injunction on the ground that the October 29 Memoranda had superseded the June 1 Memorandum.  But the Court of Appeals denied the motion and instead affirmed the District Courts judgment in full.  With respect to the INA question, the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Courts analysis that terminating the program would violate the INA, concluding that the return policy was mandatory so long as illegal entrants were being released into the United States.  The Court of Appeals also held that [t]he October 29 Memoranda did not constitute a new and separately reviewable final agency action.  20 F. 4th 928, 951.   Held:The Governments rescission of MPP did not violate section 1225 of the INA, and the October 29 Memoranda constituted final agency action.  Pp. 825. (a)Beginning with jurisdiction, the injunction that the District Court entered in this case violated\n","\n","8 U.S. C. 1252(f)(1).  See Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. ___, ___.  But section 1252(f)(1) does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction to reach the merits of an appeal even where a lower court enters a form of relief barred by that provision.  Section 1252(f)(1) withdraws a district courts jurisdiction or authority to grant a particular form of relief.  It does not deprive lower courts of all subject matter jurisdiction over claims brought under sections 1221 through 1232 of the INA.   The text of the provision makes that clear.  Section 1252(f)(1) deprives courts of the power to issue a specific category of remedies: those that enjoin or restrain the operation of the relevant sections of the statute.  And Congress included that language in a provision whose titleLimit on injunctive reliefmakes clear the narrowness of its scope.  Moreover, the provision contains a parenthetical that explicitly preserves this Courts power to enter injunctive relief.  If section 1252(f)(1) deprived lower courts of subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate any non-individual claims under sections 1221 through 1232, no such claims could ever arrive at this Court, rendering the specific carveout for Supreme Court injunctive relief nugatory. Statutory structure likewise confirms this conclusion.  Elsewhere in section 1252, where Congress intended to deny subject matter jurisdiction over a particular class of claims, it did so unambiguously.  See, e.g., 1252(a)(2) (entitled Matters not subject to judicial review).  Finally, this Court previously encountered a virtually identical situation in Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. ___, and proceeded to reach the merits of the suit notwithstanding the District Courts apparent violation of section 1252(f)(1).  Pp.813. (b)Turning to the merits, section 1225(b)(2)(C) provides: In the case of an alien ... who is arriving on land ... from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States, the [Secretary] may return the alien to that territory pending a proceeding under section 1229a.  Section 1225(b)(2)(C) plainly confers a discretionary authority to return aliens to Mexico.  This Court has repeatedly observed that the word may clearly connotes discretion.  Opati v. Republic of Sudan, 590 U.S. ___, ___.   Respondents and the Court of Appeals concede that point, but urge an inference from the statutory structure: because section 1225(b)(2)(A) makes detention mandatory, they argue, the otherwise-discretionary return authority in section 1225(b)(2)(C) becomes mandatory when the Secretary violates that mandate.  The problem is that the statute does not say anything like that.  The statute says may.  If Congress had intended section 1225(b)(2)(C) to operate as a mandatory cure of any noncompliance with the Governments detention obligations, it would not have conveyed that intention through an unspoken inference in conflict with the unambiguous, express term may.  The contiguous-territory return authority in section 1225(b)(2)(C) is discretionaryand remains discretionary notwithstanding any violation of section 1225(b)(2)(A).   The historical context in which section 1225(b)(2)(C) was adopted confirms the plain import of its text.  Section 1225(b)(2)(C) was added to the statute more than 90 years after the shall be detained language that appears in section 1225(b)(2)(A).  And the provision was enacted in response to a BIA decision that had questioned the legality of the contiguous-territory return practice.  Moreover, since its enactment, every Presidential administration has interpreted section 1225(b)(2)(C) as purely discretionary, notwithstanding the consistent shortfall of funds to comply with section 1225(b)(2)(A).   The foreign affairs consequences of mandating the exercise of contiguous-territory return likewise confirm that the Court of Appeals erred.  Interpreting section 1225(b)(2)(C) as a mandate imposes a significant burden upon the Executives ability to conduct diplomatic relations with Mexico, one that Congress likely did not intend section 1225(b)(2)(C) to impose.  And finally, the availability of parole as an alternative means of processing applicants for admission, see\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A), additionally makes clear that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the INA required the Government to continue implementing MPP.  Pp. 1318. (c)The Court of Appeals also erred in holding that [t]he October 29 Memoranda did not constitute a new and separately reviewable final agency action.  20 F. 4th, at 951.  Once the District Court vacated the June 1 Memorandum and remanded to DHS for further consideration, DHS had two options: elaborate on its original reasons for taking action or deal with the problem afresh by taking new agency action.  Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. ___, ___.  The Secretary selected the second option from Regents: He accepted the District Courts vacatur and dealt with the problem afresh.  The October 29 Memoranda were therefore final agency action for the same reasons that the June 1 Memorandum was final agency action: Both mark[ed] the consummation of the agencys decisionmaking process and resulted in rights and obligations [being] determined.  Bennett v. Spear,\n","\n","520 U.S. 154, 178.   The various rationales offered by respondents and the Court of Appeals in support of the contrary conclusion lack merit.  First, the Court of Appeals erred to the extent it understood itself to be reviewing an abstract decision apart from the specific agency actions contained in the June 1 Memorandum and October 29 Memoranda.  Second, and relatedly, the October 29 Memoranda were not a mere posthoc rationalization of the June 1 Memorandum.  The prohibition on posthoc rationalization applies only when the agency proceeds by the first option from Regents.  Here, the Secretary chose the second option from Regents and issue[d] a new rescission bolstered by new reasons absent from the [June 1] Memorandum.  591 U.S., at ___.  Having returned to the drawing table, the Secretary was not subject to the charge of posthoc rationalization.   Third, respondents invoke Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. ___.  But nothing in this record suggests a significant mismatch between the decision the Secretary made and the rationale he provided.  Id., at ___.  Relatedly, the Court of Appeals charged that the Secretary failed to proceed with a sufficiently open mind.  But this Court has previously rejected criticisms of agency closemindedness based on an identity between proposed and final agency action.  See Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 591 U.S. ___, ___.  Finally, the Court of Appeals erred to the extent it viewed the Governments decision to appeal the District Courts injunction as relevant to the question of the October 29 Memorandas status as final agency action.  Nothing prevents an agency from undertaking new agency action while simultaneously appealing an adverse judgment against its original action.  Pp.1825. 20 F.4th 928, reversed and remanded.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21954 _________________ JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, etal., PETITIONERS v. TEXAS, etal. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit [June 30, 2022]  Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court. In January 2019, the Department of Homeland Securityunder the administration of President Trumpestablished the Migrant Protection Protocols.  That program provided for the return to Mexico of non-Mexican aliens who had been detained attempting to enter the United States illegally from Mexico.  On Inauguration Day 2021, the new administration of President Biden announced that the program would be suspended the next day, and later that year sought to terminate it.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals, however, held that doing so would violate the Immigration and Nationality Act, concluding that the return policy was mandatory so long as illegal entrants were being released into the United States.  The District Court also held that the attempted rescission of the program was inadequately explained in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.  While its appeal was pending, the Government took new action to terminate the policy with a more detailed explanation.  But the Court of Appeals held that this new action was not separately reviewable final agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act. The questions presented are whether the Governments rescission of the Migrant Protection Protocols violated the Immigration and Nationality Act and whether the Governments second termination of the policy was a valid final agency action. I A On December 20, 2018, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen announced a new program called Remain in Mexico, also known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).  MPP was created in response to an immigration surge at the countrys southern border, and a resulting humanitarian and border security crisis in which federal immigration officials were encountering approximately 2,000 inadmissible aliens each day.  554 F.Supp. 3d 818, 831 (ND Tex. 2021).  MPP provided that certain non-Mexican nationals arriving by land from Mexico would be returned to Mexico to await the results of their removal proceedings under\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1229a.  On the same day that Secretary Nielsen announced the program, the Government of Mexico agreed that it would cooperate in administering it, on a temporary basis. MPP was implemented pursuant to express congressional authorization in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which provides that [i]n the case of an alien ... who is arriving on land (whether or not at a designated port of arrival) from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States, the Attorney General may return the alien to that territory pending a proceeding under section 1229a of this title.\n","\n","66Stat.\n","163, as added and amended,\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C).[1]  Prior to the initiation of MPP, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its predecessor agency had primarily used [1225(b)(2)(C)] on an ad-hoc basis to return certain Mexican and Canadian nationals arriving at ports of entry.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 273a, n.12. A separate provision of the same section of the INA states that if an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a proceeding under section 1229a of this title.  1225(b)(2)(A).  Due to consistent and significant funding shortfalls, however, DHS has never had sufficient detention capacity to maintain in custody every single person described in section 1225.  Id., at 323a.  In light of that fact, the Trump administration chose to implement MPP in part so that [c]ertain aliens attempting to enter the U.S. illegally or without documentation, including those who claim asylum, will no longer be released into the country, where they often fail to file an asylum application and/or disappear before an immigration judge can determine the merits of any claim.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 832. In January 2019, DHS began implementing MPP, initially in San Diego, California, then in El Paso, Texas, and Calexico, California, and then nationwide.  By December 31, 2020, DHS had enrolled 68,039 aliens in the program. Following the change in Presidential administrations, however, the Biden administration sought to terminate the program.  On January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security wrote that [e]ffective January 21, 2021, the Department will suspend new enrollments in [MPP] pending further review of the program.  Aliens who are not already enrolled in MPP should be processed under other existing legal authorities.  Id., at 836.  President Biden also issued Executive Order No. 14010, which directed the new Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, to promptly review and determine whether to terminate or modify the [MPP] program.  86 Fed. Reg. 8269 (2021). On June 1, 2021, Secretary Mayorkas issued a memorandum officially terminating MPP (the June 1 Memorandum).  In that memorandum, the Secretary noted his determination that MPP [d]oes not adequately or sustainably enhance border management in such a way as to justify the programs extensive operational burdens and other shortfalls.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 351a.  He also emphasized that, since its inception, MPP had played an outsized role in [DHSs] engagement with the Government of Mexico, given the significant attention that it draws away from other elements that necessarily must be more central to the bilateral relationship.  Id., at 357a.  For those and other reasons, the Secretary announced that he was by this memorandum terminating the MPP program, and direct[ed] DHS personnel to take all appropriate actions to terminate MPP, including taking all steps necessary to rescind implementing guidance and other directives or policy guidance issued to implement the program.  Id., at 348a349a. B On April 13, 2021, the States of Texas and Missouri (respondents) initiated this lawsuit in the Northern District of Texas against Secretary Mayorkas and others.  Respondents initial complaint challenged the Acting Secretarys January 20 suspension of new enrollments in MPP, but following the June 1 Memorandum, they amended their complaint to challenge the Secretarys June 1 rescission of the entire program.  The amended complaint asserted that the June 1 Memorandum violated the INA and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),\n","\n","5 U.S.C. 701 etseq., and sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and vacatur of the rescission pursuant to the APA. The District Court conducted a one-day bench trial and entered judgment for respondents.  The court first concluded that terminating MPP would violate the INA.  It reasoned that section 1225 of the INA provides the government two options: mandatory detention pursuant to section 1225(b)(2)(A) or contiguous-territory return pursuant to section 1225(b)(2)(C).  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 852.  Because the Government was unable to meet its detention obligations under section 1225(b)(2)(A) due to resource constraints, the court concluded, terminating MPP necessarily leads to the systemic violation of Section 1225 as aliens are released into the United States.  Ibid.  Second, the District Court found that the agency failed to engage in reasoned decisionmaking and therefore acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the APA.  Id., at 847851. Based on these conclusions, the District Court vacated [the June 1 Memorandum] in its entirety and remanded to DHS for further consideration.  Id., at 857 (boldface and capitalization omitted).  And it imposed a nationwide injunction ordering the Government to enforce and implement MPP in good faith until such a time as it has been lawfully rescinded in compliance with the APA and until such a time as the federal government has sufficient detention capacity to detain all aliens subject to mandatory detention under [section 1225] without releasing any aliens because of a lack of detention resources.  Ibid. (emphasis in original). The Government appealed and sought a stay of the injunction, which the District Court and the Court of Appeals each denied.  The Government then applied to this Court for a stay.  The Court denied the application, finding that the Government had failed to show a likelihood of success on the claim that the [June 1 Memorandum] was not arbitrary and capricious.  594 U.S. ___ (2021).  The Court did not address the District Courts interpretation of the INA. The parties proceeded to briefing in the Court of Appeals.  While the Governments appeal was pending, however, Secretary Mayorkas considered anew whether to maintain, terminate, or modify MPP in various ways.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 286a.  On September 29, 2021, the Secretary publicly announced his inten[tion] to issue in the coming weeks a new memorandum terminating [MPP].  20 F. 4th 928, 954 (CA5 2021).  The Government then moved to hold the appeal in abeyance pending the Secretarys formal decision, but the Court of Appeals denied the motion. On October 29, the Secretary released a four-page memorandum that again announced the termination of MPP, along with a 39-page addendum explaining his reasons for doing so (the October 29 Memoranda).  As the Secretary explained, this new assessment of MPP examined considerations that the District Court determined were insufficiently addressed in the June 1 memo, including claims that MPP discouraged unlawful border crossings, decreased the filing of non-meritorious asylum claims, and facilitated more timely relief for asylum seekers, as well as predictions that termination of MPP would lead to a border surge, cause [DHS] to fail to comply with alleged detention obligations under the [INA], impose undue costs on states, and put a strain on U.S.-Mexico relations.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 259a260a. The Secretary acknowledged what he called the strongest argument in favor of retaining MPP: namely, the significant decrease in border encounters following the determination to implement MPP across the southern border.  Id., at 261a.  But he nonetheless concluded that the programs benefits do not justify the costs, particularly given the way in which MPP detracts from other regional and domestic goals, foreign-policy objectives, and domestic policy initiatives that better align with this Administrations values.  Ibid.  Finally, the Secretary once again noted that [e]fforts to implement MPP have played a particularly outsized role in diplomatic engagements with Mexico, diverting attention from more productive efforts to fight transnational criminal and smuggling networks and address the root causes of migration.  Id., at 262a. In light of those conclusions, the Secretary announced that he was once again hereby terminating MPP.  Id., at 263a.  He explained that DHS would continue complying with the [District Courts] injunction requiring good-faith implementation and enforcement of MPP.  Id., at 264a.  But he noted that the termination of MPP would be implemented as soon as practicable after a final judicial decision to vacate that injunction.  Ibid.  The Government then moved to vacate the injunction on the ground that the October 29 Memoranda had superseded the June 1 Memorandum, but the Court of Appeals denied the motion. The Court of Appeals instead affirmed the District Courts judgment in full.  With respect to the INA question, the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Courts analysis of the relevant provisions.  That is, the court explained, section 1225(b)(2)(A) sets forth a general, plainly obligatory rule: detention for aliens seeking admission, while section 1225(b)(2)(C) authorizes contiguous-territory return as an alternative.  20 F. 4th, at 996.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals reasoned, DHS is violating (A)s mandate, refusing to avail itself of (C)s authorized alternative, and then complaining that it doesnt like its options.  Ibid., n.18. The Court of Appeals also held that [t]he October 29 Memoranda did not constitute a new and separately reviewable final agency action.  Id., at 951.  The Court of Appeals distinguished DHSs June 1 decision to terminate MPP, which it claimed had legal effect, from the June 1 Memorandum, the October 29 Memoranda, and any other subsequent memos, which it held simply explained DHSs decision.  Ibid.  The Court of Appeals then criticized the Government for proceeding without a hint of an intention to put the Termination Decision back on the chopping block and rethink things, and for ultimately just further defend[ing] what it had previously decided.  Id., at 955.  And the Court of Appeals drew a dichotomy between taking new agency action and appealing an adverse decision, asserting that DHS chose not to take a new agency action but instead chose to notice an appeal and defend its Termination Decision in our court.  Id., at 941. We granted certiorari, 595 U.S. ___ (2022), and expedited consideration of this appeal at the Governments request. II We begin with jurisdiction.  The Government contends that the injunction the District Court entered was barred by\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1252(f)(1).  That provision reads as follows: Regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party or parties bringing the action, no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of [8 U.S.C. 12211232], other than with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under [those provisions] have been initiated. As we recently held in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. ___ (2022), section 1252(f)(1) generally prohibits lower courts from entering injunctions that order federal officials to take or to refrain from taking actions to enforce, implement, or otherwise carry out the specified statutory provisions.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  The District Courts injunction in this case violated that provision.  But that fact simply presents us with the following question: whether section 1252(f)(1) deprives this Court of jurisdiction to reach the merits of an appeal, where the lower court entered a form of relief barred by that provision.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment,\n","\n","523 U.S. 83, 95 (1998) (Every federal appellate court has an obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review, even though the parties are prepared to concede it. (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). Absent section 1252(f)(1), the District Court clearly had federal question jurisdiction over respondents suit, which asserted claims arising under two federal statutes, the INA and the APA.  See\n","\n","28 U.S.C. 1331 (The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.).  The question, then, is whether section 1252(f)(1) strips the lower courts of subject matter jurisdiction over these claims.  The parties agree that the answer to that question is no, and so do we.  That is because section 1252(f)(1) withdraws a district courts jurisdiction or authority to grant a particular form of relief.  It does not deprive the lower courts of all subject matter jurisdiction over claims brought under sections 1221 through 1232 of the INA. The text of the provision makes that clear.  Section 1252(f)(1) deprives courts of the power to issue a specific category of remedies: those that enjoin or restrain the operation of the relevant sections of the statute.  A limitation on subject matter jurisdiction, by contrast, restricts a courts power to adjudicate a case.  United States v. Cotton,\n","\n","535 U.S. 625, 630 (2002).  Section 1252(f)(1) bears no indication that lower courts lack power to hear any claim brought under sections 1221 through 1232.  If Congress had wanted the provision to have that effect, it could have said so in words far simpler than those that it wrote.  But Congress instead provided that lower courts would lack jurisdiction to enjoin or restrain the operation of the relevant provisions, and it included that language in a provision whose titleLimit on injunctive reliefmakes clear the narrowness of its scope. A second feature of the text of section 1252(f)(1) leaves no doubt that this Court has jurisdiction: the parenthetical explicitly preserving this Courts power to enter injunctive relief.  See 1252(f)(1) ([N]o court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority ...).  If section 1252(f)(1) deprived lower courts of subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate any non-individual claims under sections 1221 through 1232, no such claims could ever arrive at this Court, rendering the provisions specific carveout for Supreme Court injunctive relief nugatory.  Indeed, that carveout seems directed at precisely the question before us here: whether section 1252(f)(1)s [l]imit on injunctive relief has any consequence for the jurisdiction of this Court.  Congress took pains to answer that question in the negative.  Interpreting section 1252(f)(1) to deprive this Court of jurisdiction under these circumstances would therefore fail to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of [the] statute.  Williams v. Taylor,\n","\n","529 U.S. 362, 404 (2000).[2] Statutory structure confirms our conclusion.  Elsewhere in section 1252, where Congress intended to deny subject matter jurisdiction over a particular class of claims, it did so unambiguously.  Section 1252(a)(2), for instance, is entitled Matters not subject to judicial review and provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review several categories of decisions, such as any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense....  (Emphasis added.)  Congress could easily have added one more item to this list: any action taken pursuant to sections 1221 through 1232.  Or it could have worded section 1252(f)(1) similarly to the immediately adjacent section 1252(g), which provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against [the alien].  (Emphasis added.)  But Congress did neither.  Instead, it constructed a carefully worded provision depriving the lower courts of power to enjoin or restrain the operation of certain sections of the statute, and it entitled that provision a [l]imit on injunctive relief. Our prior cases have already embraced this straightforward conclusion.  Most relevantly, the Court previously encountered a virtually identical situation in Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. ___ (2019).  There, as here, the plaintiffs sought declaratory as well as injunctive relief in their complaint, and there, as here, the District Court awarded only the latter.  Yet this Court proceeded to reach the merits of the suit, notwithstanding the District Courts apparent violation of section 1252(f)(1), by reasoning that [w]hether the [District] [C]ourt had jurisdiction to enter such an injunction is irrelevant because the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs request for declaratory relief.  Id., at ______ (Alito, J., joined by Roberts, C. J., and Kavanaugh, J.) (slip op., at 89); see also Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. ___, ___ (2018) (Breyer, J., joined by Ginsburg and Sotomayor, JJ., dissenting) (slip op., at 31) (concluding that a court could order declaratory relief notwithstanding section 1252(f)(1)).  Our disposition in Preap is inconsistent with an interpretation of the limitation in section 1252(f)(1) that strips the lower courts of subject matter jurisdiction.[3]  And previous statements from this Court regarding section 1252(f)(1) are in accord.  See Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm.,\n","\n","525 U.S. 471, 481 (1999) (By its plain terms, and even by its title, [section 1252(f)(1)] is nothing more or less than a limit on injunctive relief.). In short, we see no basis for the conclusion that section 1252(f)(1) concerns subject matter jurisdiction.  It is true that section 1252(f)(1) uses the phrase jurisdiction or authority, rather than simply the word authority.  But [j]urisdiction ... is a word of many, too many meanings.  Steel Co., 523 U.S., at 90.  And the question whether a court has jurisdiction to grant a particular remedy is different from the question whether it has subject matter jurisdiction over a particular class of claims.  See Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick,\n","\n","559 U.S. 154, 163164 (2010) (concluding that [t]he word jurisdiction ... says nothing about whether a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate claims).  Section 1252(f)(1) no doubt deprives the lower courts of jurisdiction to grant classwide injunctive relief.  See Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  But that limitation poses no obstacle to jurisdiction in this Court.[4] III We now turn to the merits.  Section 1225(b)(2)(C) provides: In the case of an alien ... who is arriving on land ... from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States, the [Secretary] may return the alien to that territory pending a proceeding under section 1229a.  Section 1225(b)(2)(C) plainly confers a discretionary authority to return aliens to Mexico during the pendency of their immigration proceedings.  This Court has repeatedly observed that the word may clearly connotes discretion.  Opati v. Republic of Sudan, 590 U.S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 10) (emphasis in original); see also, e.g., Weyerhaeuser Co. v. United States Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U.S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 14); Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,\n","\n","543 U.S. 335, 346 (2005).  The use of the word may in section 1225(b)(2)(C) thus makes clear that contiguous-territory return is a tool that the Secretary has the authority, but not the duty, to use.  Lopez v. Davis,\n","\n","531 U.S. 230, 241 (2001). Respondents and the Court of Appeals concede this point.  Brief for Respondents 21 (contiguous-territory return is a discretionary authority); 20 F. 4th, at 996, n.18 (Its obviously true that 1225(b)(2)(C) is discretionary.).  They base their interpretation instead on section 1225(b)(2)(A), which provides that, in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a proceeding under section 1229a of this title.  Respondents and the Court of Appeals thus urge an inference from the statutory structure: Because section 1225(b)(2)(A) makes detention mandatory, they argue, the otherwise-discretionary return authority in section 1225(b)(2)(C) becomes mandatory when the Secretary violates that detention mandate.   The problem is that the statute does not say anything like that.  The statute says may.  And may does not just suggest discretion, it clearly connotes it.  Opati, 590 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (emphasis in original); see also Jama, 543 U.S., at 346 (That connotation is particularly apt where, as here, may is used in contraposition to the word shall.).  Congresss use of the word may is therefore inconsistent with respondents proposed inference from the statutory structure.  If Congress had intended section 1225(b)(2)(C) to operate as a mandatory cure of any noncompliance with the Governments detention obligations, it would not have conveyed that intention through an unspoken inference in conflict with the unambiguous, express term may.  It would surely instead have coupled that grant of discretion with some indication of its sometimes-mandatory natureperhaps by providing that the Secretary may return certain aliens to Mexico, unless the government fails to comply with its detention obligations, in which case the Secretary must return them.  The statutory grant of discretion here contains no such caveat, and we will not rewrite it to include one.  See id., at 341 (We do not lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply.). The principal dissent emphasizes that section 1225(b)(2)(A) requires detention of all aliens that fall within its terms.  See, e.g., post, at 8 (Alito, J., dissenting) (The language of\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(A) is unequivocal.).  While the Government contests that proposition, we assume arguendo for purposes of this opinion that the dissents interpretation of section 1225(b)(2)(A) is correct, and that the Government is currently violating its obligations under that provision.[5]  Even so, the dissents conclusions regarding section 1225(b)(2)(C) do not follow.  Under the actual text of the statute, Justice Alitos interpretation is practically self-refuting.  He emphasizes that [s]hall be detained means shall be detained, post, at 9, and criticizes the Governments argument that shall means may, post, at 10.  But the theory works both ways.  Congress conferred contiguous-territory return authority in expressly discretionary terms.  [M]ay return the alien means may return the alien. The desire to redress the Governments purported violation of section 1225(b)(2)(A) does not justify transforming the nature of the authority conferred by section 1225(b)(2)(C).[6] The historical context in which the provision was adopted confirms the plain import of its text.  See, e.g., Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 U.S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 9) (textual analysis confirmed by a wider look at [the statutes] structure and history).  Section 1225(b)(2)(C) was not added to the statute until 1996, in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 302,\n","\n","110Stat.\n","300583more than 90 years after the Immigration Act of 1903 added the shall be detained language that appears in section 1225(b)(2)(A).  And section 1225(b)(2)(C) was enacted in the immediate aftermath of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision that specifically called into question the legality of the contiguous-territory return practice.  Prior to that decision, the longstanding practice of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) had been to require some aliens arriving at land border ports of entry to await their exclusion proceedings in Canada or Mexico.  The BIA noted the lack of any evidence that this is a practice known to Congress and the absence of a supporting regulation.  Inre Sanchez-Avila, 21 I. & N. Dec. 444, 465 (1996) (en banc).  Congress responded mere months later by adding section 1225(b)(2)(C) to IIRIRA and conferring on the Secretary express authority (may) to engage in the very practice that the BIA had questioned.  And INS acknowledged that clarification shortly thereafter, explaining that section 1225(b)(2)(C) and its implementing regulation simply add[] to the statute and regulation a long-standing practice of the Service.  62 Fed. Reg. 445 (1997).  That modest backstory suggests a more humble role for section 1225(b)(2)(C) than as a mandatory safety valve for any alien who is not detained under section 1225(b)(2)(A). In addition to contradicting the statutory text and context, the novelty of respondents interpretation bears mention.  Since IIRIRAs enactment 26 years ago, every Presidential administration has interpreted section 1225(b)(2)(C) as purely discretionary.  Indeed, at the time of IIRIRAs enactment and in the decades since, congressional funding has consistently fallen well short of the amount needed to detain all land-arriving inadmissible aliens at the border, yet no administration has ever used section 1225(b)(2)(C) to return all such aliens that it could not otherwise detain. And the foreign affairs consequences of mandating the exercise of contiguous-territory return likewise confirm that the Court of Appeals erred.  Article II of the Constitution authorizes the Executive to engag[e] in direct diplomacy with foreign heads of state and their ministers.  Zivotofsky v. Kerry,\n","\n","576 U.S. 1, 14 (2015).  Accordingly, the Court has taken care to avoid the danger of unwarranted judicial interference in the conduct of foreign policy, and declined to run interference in [the] delicate field of international relations without the affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed.  Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.,\n","\n","569 U.S. 108, 115116 (2013).  That is no less true in the context of immigration law, where [t]he dynamic nature of relations with other countries requires the Executive Branch to ensure that enforcement policies are consistent with this Nations foreign policy.  Arizona v. United States,\n","\n","567 U.S. 387, 397 (2012). By interpreting section 1225(b)(2)(C) as a mandate, the Court of Appeals imposed a significant burden upon the Executives ability to conduct diplomatic relations with Mexico.  MPP applies exclusively to non-Mexican nationals who have arrived at ports of entry that are located in the United States.  1225(a)(1).  The Executive therefore cannot unilaterally return these migrants to Mexico.  In attempting to rescind MPP, the Secretary emphasized that [e]fforts to implement MPP have played a particularly outsized role in diplomatic engagements with Mexico, diverting attention from more productive efforts to fight transnational criminal and smuggling networks and address the root causes of migration.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 262a.  Yet under the Court of Appeals interpretation, section 1225(b)(2)(C) authorized the District Court to force the Executive to the bargaining table with Mexico, over a policy that both countries wish to terminate, and to supervise its continuing negotiations with Mexico to ensure that they are conducted in good faith.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 857 (emphasis deleted).  That stark consequence confirms our conclusion that Congress did not intend section 1225(b)(2)(C) to tie the hands of the Executive in this manner. Finally, we note thatas DHS explained in its October 29 Memorandathe INA expressly authorizes DHS to process applicants for admission under a third option: parole.  See\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A).  Every administration, including the Trump and Biden administrations, has utilized this authority to some extent.  Importantly, the authority is not unbounded: DHS may exercise its discretion to parole applicants only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.  Ibid.  And under the APA, DHSs exercise of discretion within that statutory framework must be reasonable and reasonably explained.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,\n","\n","463 U.S. 29 (1983).  But the availability of the parole option additionally makes clear that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the INA required the Government to continue implementing MPP. In sum, the contiguous-territory return authority in section 1225(b)(2)(C) is discretionaryand remains discretionary notwithstanding any violation of section 1225(b)(2)(A).  To reiterate: we need not and do not resolve the parties arguments regarding whether section 1225(b)(2)(A) must be read in light of traditional principles of law enforcement discretion, and whether the Government is lawfully exercising its parole authorities pursuant to sections 1182(d)(5) and 1226(a).  We merely hold that section 1225(b)(2)(C) means what it says: may means may, and the INA itself does not require the Secretary to continue exercising his discretionary authority under these circumstances. IV The Court of Appeals also erred in holding that [t]he October 29 Memoranda did not constitute a new and separately reviewable final agency action.  20 F. 4th, at 951.  To recap, the Secretary first attempted to terminate MPP through the June 1 Memorandum.  As the Court of Appeals correctly held, that constituted final agency action.  See id., at 947 (citing Bennett v. Spear,\n","\n","520 U.S. 154 (1997)).  But the District Court found that the Secretarys stated grounds in the June 1 Memorandum were inadequate, and therefore vacated the June 1 Memorandum and remanded [the matter] to DHS for further consideration.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 857. As we explained two Terms ago in Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. ___ (2020), upon finding that the grounds for agency action are inadequate, a court may remand for the agency to do one of two things.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  First, the agency can offer a fuller explanation of the agencys reasoning at the time of the agency action.  Ibid. (emphasis deleted).  If it chooses this route, the agency may elaborate on its initial reasons for taking the action, but may not provide new ones.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  Alternatively, the agency can deal with the problem afresh by taking new agency action.  Ibid. (quoting SEC v. Chenery Corp.,\n","\n","332 U.S. 194, 201 (1947) (Chenery II)).  An agency taking this route is not limited to its prior reasons.  Regents, 591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 14). Here, perhaps in light of this Courts previous determination that the Government had failed to show a likelihood of success on the claim that the [June 1 Memorandum] was not arbitrary and capricious, 594 U.S. ___, the Secretary selected the second option from Regents: He accepted the District Courts vacatur and dealt with the problem afresh.  The October 29 Memoranda made that clear by its own terms, Regents, 591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 14), in which the Secretary stated: I am hereby terminating MPP.  Effective immediately, I hereby supersede and rescind the June 1 memorandum.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 263a264a.  And consistent with that approach, the October 29 Memoranda offered several new reasons absent from the June 1 Memorandum, Regents, 591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 14), including an examination of the considerations that the District Court determined were insufficiently addressed in the June 1 memo, App. to Pet. for Cert. 259a. The October 29 Memoranda were therefore final agency action for the same reasons that the June 1 Memorandum was final agency action.  That is, both the June 1 Memorandum and the October 29 Memoranda, when they were issued, mark[ed] the consummation of the agencys decisionmaking process and resulted in rights and obligations [being] determined.  Bennett, 520 U.S., at 178.  As the Court of Appeals explained, the June 1 Memorandum bound DHS staff by forbidding them to continue the program in any way from that moment on.  20 F. 4th, at 947.  That rationale also applies to the October 29 Memoranda, which were therefore final agency action under the APA.[7] The various rationales offered by respondents and the Court of Appeals in support of the contrary conclusion lack merit.[8]  First, the Court of Appeals framed the question by postulating the existence of an agency decision wholly apart from any agency statement of general or particular applicability ... designed to implement that decision.  5    U.S.C. 551(4); see 20 F. 4th, at 950951 (The States are challenging the Termination Decisionnot the June 1 Memorandum, the October 29 Memoranda, or any other memo.).  To the extent that the Court of Appeals understood itself to be reviewing an abstract decision apart from specific agency action, as defined in the APA, that was error.  It was not the case that the June 1 Memorandum and the October 29 Memoranda simply explained DHSs decision, while only the decision itself had legal effect.  Id., at 951.  To the contrary, the June 1 Memorandum and the October 29 Memoranda were themselves the operative agency actions, each of them an agency statement ... designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.\n","\n","5 U.S.C. 551(4). Second, and relatedly, respondents characterized the October 29 Memoranda as posthoc rationalizations of the June 1 Memorandum under our decision in Regents.  Brief for Respondents 40 ([T]he [October 29] Memoranda are nothing more than improper, posthoc rationalizations for terminating MPP.); see also 20 F. 4th, at 961 (questioning how the October 29 Memoranda [could] be anything more than posthoc rationalizations of the Termination Decision).  But Regents involved the exact opposite situation from this one.  There, as here, DHS had attempted to rescind a prior administrations immigration policy, but a District Court found the rescission inadequately explained.  Faced with the same two options outlined above, then- Secretary Nielsen elected the first option rather than the second.  That is, she chose to rest on the [original] Memorandum while elaborating on [her] prior reasoning, rather than issue a new rescission bolstered by new reasons absent from the [original] Memorandum.  591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  As such, her elaboration was limited to the agencys original reasons, and was viewed critically to ensure that the rescission [was] not upheld on the basis of impermissible posthoc rationalization.  Id., at ______ (slip op., at 1415).  And because the then-Secretarys reasoning had little relationship to that of her predecessor, the Court characterized the new explanations as impermissible posthoc rationalizations ... not properly before us.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15). The prohibition on posthoc rationalization applies only when the agency proceeds by the first option from Regents.  Under that circumstance, because the agency has chosen to rest on [its original action] while elaborating on its prior reasoning, id., at ___ (slip op., at 14), the bar on posthoc rationalization operates to ensure that the agencys supplemental explanation is anchored to the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the action, Michigan v. EPA,\n","\n","576 U.S. 743, 758 (2015).  By contrast, as noted above, the Secretary here chose the second option from Regents, and deal[t] with the problem afresh by taking new agency action.  591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  That second option can be more procedurally onerous than the firstthe agency must comply with the procedural requirements for new agency actionbut the benefit is that the agency is not limited to its prior reasons in justifying its decision.  Ibid.  Indeed, the entire purpose of the October 29 Memoranda was for the Secretary to issue a new rescission bolstered by new reasons absent from the [June 1] Memorandum, ibid.reasons that he hoped would answer the District Courts concerns from the first go-round.  Having returned to the drawing table and taken new action, therefore, the Secretary was not subject to the charge of posthoc rationalization. Third, respondents invoke our decision in Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. ___ (2019), to contend that DHSs failure to hew[] to the administrative straight and narrow deprives the October 29 Memoranda of the presumption of regularity that normally attends agency action, Brief for Respondents 43.  As we explained in that case, in reviewing agency action, a court is ordinarily limited to evaluating the agencys contemporaneous explanation in light of the existing administrative record.  Department of Commerce, 588 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 23).  Department of Commerce involved a narrow exception to th[at] general rule that applies where the challengers to the agencys action make a strong showing of bad faith or improper behavior on the part of the agency.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 24) (quoting Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe,\n","\n","401 U.S. 402, 420 (1971)).  We held that exception satisfied by an accumulation of unusual circumstances that demonstrated an explanation for agency action that [was] incongruent with what the record reveal[ed] about the agencys priorities and decisionmaking process.  Department of Commerce, 588 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 28). The circumstances in this case do not come close to those in Department of Commerce.  Nothing in this record suggests a significant mismatch between the decision the Secretary made and the rationale he provided.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 26).  Respondents direct us instead to the Governments litigation conduct.  But the examples of misconduct to which respondents refersuch as a failure to timely complete the administrative record, Brief for Respondents 42have no bearing on the legal status of the October 29 Memoranda.  And in any event, they fall well short of the strong showing of bad faith or improper behavior, Overton Park, 401 U.S., at 420, that we require before deviating from our normal rule that [t]he grounds upon which an administrative order must be judged are those upon which the record discloses that its action was based, SEC v. Chenery Corp.,\n","\n","318 U.S. 80, 87 (1943). The Court of Appeals leveled the related but more modest charge that the Secretary failed to proceed with a sufficiently open mind.  See, e.g., 20 F. 4th, at 955 (agency proceeded without a hint of an intention to put the Termination Decision back on the chopping block and rethink things).  But the agencys ex ante preference for terminating MPPlike any other feature of an administrations policy agendashould not be held against the October 29 Memoranda.  It is hardly improper for an agency head to come into office with policy preferences and ideas ... and work with staff attorneys to substantiate the legal basis for a preferred policy.  Department of Commerce, 588 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 26); see also State Farm, 463 U.S., at 59 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (As long as [an] agency remains within the bounds established by Congress, it is entitled to assess administrative records and evaluate priorities in light of the philosophy of the administration. (footnote omitted)). And the critique is particularly weak on these facts.  The Court of Appeals took the agency to task for its September 29 announcement of its inten[tion] to issue in the coming weeks a new memorandum terminating MPP.  20 F. 4th, at 954; see ibid. (Rather than announcing an intention to reconsider its Termination Decision, the announcement set forth DHSs conclusion in unmistakable terms.).  But that announcement came over six weeks after the District Courts August 13 remanda substantial window of time for the agency to conduct a bona fide reconsideration. More importantly, this Court has previously rejected criticisms of agency closemindedness based on an identity between proposed and final agency action.  See Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 591 U.S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 24) (declin[ing] to evaluate the [agencys] final rules under [an] open-mindedness test where interim and final rules were virtually identical but procedural requirements were otherwise satisfied).  Similar principles refute the Court of Appeals criticism of the October 29 Memoranda for their failure to alter the Termination Decision in any way.  20 F. 4th, at 946.  It is black-letter law that an agency that takes superseding action on remand is entitled to reexamine[] the problem, recast its rationale and reach[] the same result.  Chenery II, 332 U.S., at 196; see also Regents, 591 U.S., at ___ (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (slip op., at 4) (Courts often consider an agencys ... additional explanations made ... on remand from a court, even if the agencys bottom-line decision itself does not change.). Finally, the Court of Appeals erred to the extent it viewed the Governments decision to appeal the District Courts injunction as relevant to the question of the October 29 Memorandas status as final agency action.  Nothing prevents an agency from undertaking new agency action while simultaneously appealing an adverse judgment against its original action.  That is particularly so under the circumstances of this case.  The second condition of the District Courts injunction, which purported to bind DHS to implement MPP in perpetuity subject only to congressional funding choices outside its control, as a practical matter left the Government no choice but to appeal.  And the agency reasonably chose to accede to the District Courts APA analysis of the June 1 Memorandum and seek to ameliorate those concerns in the meantime. *** For the reasons explained, the Governments rescission of MPP did not violate section 1225 of the INA, and the October 29 Memoranda did constitute final agency action.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  On remand, the District Court should consider in the first instance whether the October 29 Memoranda comply with section 706 of the APA.  See State Farm, 463 U.S., at 4657. It is so ordered. &&& SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21954 _________________ JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, etal., PETITIONERS v. TEXAS, etal. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit [June 30, 2022] Justice Kavanaugh, concurring. I agree with the Court that the District Court had jurisdiction over Texass suit.  I also agree with the Court that the Government prevails on the merits of the two specific legal questions presented here. I note, moreover, that six Members of the Court agree with the Courts merits conclusion.  See post, at 1 (Barrett, J., dissenting).   I write separately to briefly elaborate on my understanding of the relevant statutory provisions and to point out one legal issue that remains open for resolution on remand. When the Department of Homeland Security lacks sufficient capacity to detain noncitizens at the southern border pending their immigration proceedings (often asylum proceedings), the immigration laws afford DHS two primary options. Option one:  DHS may grant noncitizens parole into the United States if parole provides a significant public benefit.\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A). Parole entails releasing individuals on a case-by-case basis into the United States subject to reasonable assurances that they will appear at all hearings.  8 CFR 212.5(d) (2020); see\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A).  Notably, every Administration beginning in the late 1990s has relied heavily on the parole option, including the administrations of Presidents Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, 4954. Option two:  DHS may choose to return noncitizens to Mexico.\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C).  Consistent with that statutory authority, the prior Administration chose to return a relatively small group of noncitizens to Mexico.   In general, when there is insufficient detention capacity, both the parole option and the return-to-Mexico option are legally permissible options under the immigration statutes.  As the recent history illustrates, every President since the late 1990s has employed the parole option, and President Trump also employed the return-to-Mexico option for a relatively small group of noncitizens.  Because the immigration statutes afford substantial discretion to the Executive, different Presidents may exercise that discretion differently.  That is Administrative Law 101.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,\n","\n","463 U.S. 29, 59 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).   To be sure, the Administrative Procedure Act and this Courts decision in State Farm require that an executive agencys exercise of discretion be reasonable and reasonably explained.  See id., at 43 (majority opinion); see also FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. ___, ______, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 78, 11); FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.,\n","\n","556 U.S. 502, 514515 (2009);\n","\n","5 U.S.C. 706.  For example, when there is insufficient detention capacity and DHS chooses to parole noncitizens into the United States rather than returning them to Mexico, DHS must reasonably explain why parole provides a significant public benefit.\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A); see, e.g., State Farm, 463 U.S., at 4657.  Review under that State Farm standard is deferential but not toothless.  Id., at 56.  The question of whether DHSs October 29 decision satisfies the State Farm standard is not before this Court at this time.  The Court today therefore properly leaves the State Farm issue for consideration on remand.  See ante, at 18, 25; Tr. of Oral Arg. 6768. To be clear, when there is insufficient detention capacity and the President chooses the parole option because he determines that returning noncitizens to Mexico is not feasible for foreign-policy reasons, a court applying State Farm must be deferential to the Presidents Article II foreign-policy judgment.  Cf., e.g., Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. ___, ______ (2018) (slip op., at 1015).  Nothing in the relevant immigration statutes at issue here suggests that Congress wanted the Federal Judiciary to improperly second-guess the Presidents Article II judgment with respect to American foreign policy and foreign relations.  See Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,\n","\n","343 U.S. 579, 635637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring); see also Dames & Moore v. Regan,\n","\n","453 U.S. 654, 678679, 686688 (1981). One final note:  The larger policy story behind this case is the multi-decade inability of the political branches to provide DHS with sufficient facilities to detain noncitizens who seek to enter the United States pending their immigration proceedings.  But this Court has authority to address only the legal issues before us.  We do not have authority to end the legislative stalemate or to resolve the underlying policy problems.  With those additional comments, I join the Courts opinion in full. &&& SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21954 _________________ JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, etal., PETITIONERS v. TEXAS, etal. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit [June 30, 2022] Justice Barrett, with whom Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, and Justice Gorsuch join as to all but the first sentence, dissenting. I agree with the Courts analysis of the meritsbut not with its decision to reach them.  The lower courts in this case concluded that\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1252(f)(1), a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act sharply limiting federal courts jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of certain immigration laws, did not present a jurisdictional bar.  Just two weeks ago, however, we repudiated their reasoning in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. ___ (2022).  Because we are a court of review and not first view, I would vacate and remand for the lower courts to reconsider their assertion of jurisdiction in light of Aleman Gonzalez. *** Section 1252(f)(1) provides that no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of specified immigration provisions, except as applied to an individual alien against whom proceedings under [those provisions] have been initiated.  Some lower courts have narrowly interpreted this provision, holding that it does not bar relief that a plaintiff frames as requir[ing] (rather than preventing) the Governments enforcement of or compliance with the covered immigration laws.  E.g., 20 F.4th 928, 1004 (CA5 2021).  In this case, that was the only ground pressed by respondents below and relied on by the lower courts to hold that 1252(f)(1) did not ba[r] jurisdiction.  Ibid.; see App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a; Brief for Appellees in No. 2110806 (CA5), pp.4041.  But we just rejected this interpretation in Aleman Gonzalez.  There, we held that 1252(f)(1) deprives lower courts of jurisdiction to entertain requests for injunctions that order federal officials to take or to refrain from taking actions to enforce, implement, or otherwise carry out the specified statutory provisions (subject to an exception, indisputably inapplicable to this case, for a suit by an individual noncitizen in proceedings under those provisions).  596 U.S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 1, 5). In the normal course, we would vacate and remand this case for further proceedings in light of Aleman Gonzalez.  Instead, the Court plows ahead to break new jurisdictional ground.  Acting on a compressed timeline, it embraces a theory of 1252(f)(1) thatso far as I can tellno court of appeals has ever adopted: that 1252(f)(1) limits only the lower courts remedial authority, not their subject-matter jurisdiction.  The only court of appeals to have addressed this theory rejected it.  Miranda v. Garland, 34 F.4th 338, 354356 (CA4 2022).  Still, the Court is confident enough to proceed based on short, barely adversarial supplemental briefs.  (The United States original brief devoted only a conclusory footnote to the jurisdictional question, and Texas and Missouri did not respond.)  And these supplemental briefs are particularly unhelpful because, having been submitted prior to our decision in Aleman Gonzalez, they could not address that decisions significance for this case.  In fact, they devoted a considerable portion of their allotted length to the issue that Aleman Gonzalez subsequently resolved. This would all matter less if the jurisdictional question were easy or unimportantbut it is neither.  The Courts opinion papers over difficult issues, as I will discuss below, and its jurisdictional holding is likely to affect many cases.  See, e.g., Texas v. Biden, ___ F.Supp. 3d ___, ___, 2022 WL 658579, *14 (ND Tex., Mar. 4, 2022) (1252(f)(1) does not bar Texas claim that the Federal Government is wrongly refusing to detain noncitizens to determine if they have COVID19); Defendants Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion for Temporary Restraining Order 89 in Arizona v. CDC, Civ. No. 6:22cv00885 (WD La., Apr. 22, 2022) (arguing that 1252(f)(1) prohibits a district court from constraining the Federal Governments removal discretion in litigation challenging termination of Title 42 order).  We should not short circuit the ordinary process. I have several doubts about the Courts analysis of 1252(f)(1).  To begin with, the Court assumes that we face an either/or choice between subject-matter jurisdiction and remedial authority, with the former being only about a courts authority to decide merits questions and the latter being only about the relief a court can grant.  Ante, at 9.  This dichotomy makes the Courts job easier, because it can use the obvious point that 1252(f)(1) strips lower courts of remedial authority to establish that 1252(f)(1) does not strip them of subject-matter jurisdiction.  But why is it a binary choice?  I would think that Congress is free to link a courts subject-matter jurisdiction to its remedial authority.  That is not so different from an amount-in-controversy requirement, which conditions a district courts ability to address the merits on the relief that the plaintiff seeks.  See, e.g.,\n","\n","28 U.S.C. 1332 (district courts have subject-matter jurisdiction over diversity cases only when the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000).  And the redressability requirement of Article III itself establishes a tie between jurisdiction and remedies, because a courts inability to order effective relief deprives it of jurisdiction to decide the merits of a question otherwise within its competence.  See, e.g., California v. Texas, 593 U.S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 7) (redressability consider[s] the relationship between the judicial relief requested and the injury suffered); Los Angeles v. Lyons,\n","\n","461 U.S. 95, 105107 (1983) (failure to allege sufficient likelihood of future injury deprives a federal court of Article III jurisdiction to entertain [the count] of the complaint seeking injunctive relief). So it seems to me quite possible that 1252(f)(1) withdraws subject-matter jurisdiction over cases seeking certain remedies.  Indeed, while the Government has a theory for why the Court can reach the merits in this case, it characterizes 1252(f)(1) as imposing jurisdictional limitations that speak to a courts power and can never be forfeited or waived.  Supplemental Brief for Petitioners 1920; see also Miranda, 34 F.4th, at 354 (concluding that 1252(f)(1) is a jurisdiction-stripping statute that cannot be waived).  If there is a reason to treat limitations on  subject-matter jurisdiction and limitations on remedial authority as mutually exclusiveeither in general or in this statutory schemethe Court does not explain it. The Court breezes past other questions too.  Most notably, it gives surprisingly little attention to a phrase on which it places significant weight: 1252(f)(1)s parenthetical exempting the Supreme Court from its general bar on jurisdiction or authority.  The parties hardly discuss this parenthetical, which does not appear to have an analogue elsewhere in the United States Code.  The Court, however, takes the phrase as conclusive evidence that 1252(f)(1) does not deprive district courts of subject- matter jurisdiction over non-individual claims under [the covered provisions], because if it did, no such claims could ever arrive at this Court, rendering the provisions specific carveout for Supreme Court injunctive relief nugatory.  Ante, at 10. While this interpretation has some surface appeal, the Court does not explain how it would work.  Does it mean that the restriction on remedial authority is subject to waiver or forfeiture, so that a lower court can sometimes properly enter non-individual injunctive relief that this Court can then review?  That a district court has the authority to enter some kinds of non-individual relief (for example, a classwide declaratory judgment) and that this Court can enter different relief (for example, a classwide injunction) on review of that judgment?  Or that this Court can enter an injunction on appeal if the district court could have entered at least one form of relief, even if it actually entered only relief that exceeded its authority?[1]*  Or perhaps the parenthetical serves the very different purpose of clarifying that 1252(f)(1) does not disturb any pre-existing authority this Court has under the All Writs Act or other sources.  These are difficult questions, yet the Court does not address any of them. Indeed, the Court explicitly chooses not to opine on some of the issues that might help explain the parentheticals unusual reservation.  See ante, at 12, n.4.  For example, the Court declines to decide whether the bar in 1252(f)(1) is subject to forfeiture, even though that is a defining feature of nonjurisdictional rules.  See, e.g., Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Servs. of Chicago, 583 U.S. ___, ______ (2017) (slip op., at 23).  It reserves the question whether 1252(f)(1) bars declaratory relief, an issue on which there are conflicting views.  Compare Alli v. Decker, 650 F.3d 1007, 1013 (CA3 2011) (it does not bar declaratory relief), with id., at 10191021 (Fuentes, J., dissenting) (it does), with Hamama v. Adducci, 912 F.3d 869, 880, n.8 (CA6 2018) (it depends).  And it avoids a position on whether 1252(f)(1) prevents a lower court from vacating or setting aside an agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act.  See\n","\n","5 U.S.C. 706(2).  Not that I fault the Court for holding back.  Quite the contrary: The questions surrounding 1252(f)(1) are complex and deserve more attention than we can give them in this posture. As a final touch, the Court asserts that our precedent has already charted this course.  Ante, at 1112.  But the Court cannot muster much on that front.  It cites a passing statement rejecting an inapposite argument that 1252(f)(1) is a jurisdictional grant, see Reno v. American-Arab Anti- Discrimination Comm.,\n","\n","525 U.S. 471, 481 (1999), a brief discussion from a plurality opinion in a case where the 1252(f)(1) issue had not been briefed or argued by the parties in this Court, see Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. ___, ______ (2019) (slip op., at 89), and a dissent, see Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S ___, ___ (2018) (opinion of Breyer, J.) (slip op., at 31).  None provides a clear roadmap for this case. *** Given all this, I would tread more carefully.  We should let the lower courts be the first to address the substantial antecedent questions that 1252(f)(1) presents in light of our hot-off-the-presses decision in Aleman Gonzalez.  I respectfully dissent. &&& SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21954 _________________ JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, etal., PETITIONERS v. TEXAS, etal. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit [June 30, 2022] Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch join, dissenting. In fiscal year 2021, the Border Patrol reported more than 1.7 million encounters with aliens along the Mexican border.[1]  When it appears that one of these aliens is not admissible, may the Government simply release the alien in this country and hope that the alien will show up for the hearing at which his or her entitlement to remain will be decided? Congress has provided a clear answer to that question, and the answer is no.  By law, if an alien is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a [removal] proceeding.\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added).  And if an alien asserts a credible fear of persecution, he or she shall be detained for further consideration of the application for asylum, 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).  Those requirements, as we have held, are mandatory.  See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 13). Congress offered the Executive twoand only twoalternatives to detention.  First, if an alien is arriving on land from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may return the alien to that territory pending a [removal] proceeding.  1225(b)(2)(C).  Second, DHS may release individual aliens on parole, but only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit.  1182(d)(5)(A). Due to the huge numbers of aliens who attempt to enter illegally from Mexico, DHS does not have the capacity to detain all inadmissible aliens encountered at the border, and no one suggests that DHS must do the impossible.  But rather than avail itself of Congresss clear statutory alternative to return inadmissible aliens to Mexico while they await proceedings in this country, DHS has concluded that it may forgo that option altogether and instead simply release into this country untold numbers of aliens who are very likely to be removed if they show up for their removal hearings.  This practice violates the clear terms of the law, but the Court looks the other way. In doing so, the majority commits three main errors.  First, it unnecessarily resolves difficult jurisdictional questions on whichdue to the Governments litigation tacticswe have received only hurried briefing and no argument.  Second, when the majority reaches the merits, it contrives a way to overlook the clear statutory violations that result from DHSs decision to terminate the use of its contiguous-territory return authority.  Finally, the majority unjustifiably faults the Court of Appeals for rejecting the Governments last-minute attempt to derail the ordinary appellate process.  I cannot go along with any of this, and I therefore respectfully dissent. I In 2018, a surge of foreign migrants attempted to enter the United States unlawfully at the United States-Mexico border, creating a humanitarian and border security crisis.  554 F.Supp. 3d 818, 831 (ND Tex. 2021).  Because existing detention facilities could not house all the people who were attempting to enter unlawfully, many illegal aliens with meritless asylum claims were being released into the United States, and many, once released, simply disappeared. Ibid. (emphasis deleted).  To address this problem, DHS promulgated the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) in December of that year.  See id., at 832.  The MPP program relied on Congresss express grant of authority to return alien[s] ... arriving on land ... from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States to that territory pending a proceeding to remove them to their countries of origin.  1225(b)(2)(C).[2]  MPP provided that certain non-Mexican nationals arriving at the United States border by land from Mexico would be returned to Mexico to await the results of their removal proceedings.  The Mexican Government agreed to cooperate and to accept aliens while they awaited removal. While the policy was in effect, DHS issued a memorandum in which it determined that MPP was an indispensable tool in addressing the ongoing crisis at the southern border. App. 189 (Department of Homeland Security: Assessment of the Migrant Protection Protocols (Oct. 28, 2019)).  It concluded that MPP directly reduced the number of aliens unlawfully released into the United States and deterred others from attempting to cross the border unlawfully in the first place.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 833.  DHS found that total border encounters decreased by 64 percent after MPP was implemented.  App. 189.  With MPP in place, aliens who lacked meritorious claims could no longer count on a free ticket into the United States, and as a result, many voluntarily return[ed] home.  Id., at 192.  MPP also helped DHS process meritorious asylum claims within months, rather than leaving asylum applicants in limbo for years.  Id., at 190. Hours after his inauguration on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order suspending MPP, and the effects on the border were immediate.  According to the Governments own data, border encounters jump[ed] from 75,000 in January 2021, when MPP was first suspended, to about 173,000 in April 2021.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 837. Two States, Texas and Missouri, brought suit under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in April 2021, alleging that suspending MPP was arbitrary and capricious and violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).  The District Court ordered the Government to file the administrative record for the January suspension, and on May 31, 2021, the Government filed a three-line suspension memorandum as the entire administrative record.  See id., at 856, n. 16.  The next day, in a 7-page memo issued by the Secretary, DHS terminated the already-suspended program. The States amended their complaint to challenge the June termination decision on largely the same grounds that they had advanced with respect to the January suspension.  After a consolidated preliminary injunction hearing and a trial on the merits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2), the District Court vacated the Governments decision to rescind MPP and enjoined the Secretary to continue to implement that policy in good faith until all the aliens in question could be detained or lawfully paroled.  Id., at 857.  The Government sought a stay of this order, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, while expediting the Governments appeal, refused to issue a stay.  10 F. 4th 538, 543561 (2021) (percuriam).  The Government then sought a stay in this Court, but we denied that application.  594 U.S. ___ (2021). On September 29, 2021, while briefing in the Court of Appeals was underway, DHS announced that it intended to issue a new memorandum terminating MPP, and the Government asked the Court of Appeals to hold its appeal in abeyance pending this promised administrative action.  App. 5152.  The Court of Appeals denied that motion, id., at 54, and then, two business days before oral argument, DHS issued two memoranda declaring that DHS had made a new decision terminating MPP.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 257a345a.  At the same time, the Government asked the Court of Appeals to hold that the case before it was moot, to vacate the District Courts judgment and injunction, and to remand the case for further proceedings.  20 F. 4th 928, 946 (CA5 2021).  The Fifth Circuit refused and held that the October 29 Memoranda did not moot the appeal or have any other legal effect on the appellate proceedings.  Id., at 956966, 9981000.  The Fifth Circuit then affirmed the District Court on the merits. II I agree with the majority that the injunction entered by the District Court in this case exceeded its jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the relevant statutes.  1252(f)(1).  That conclusion follows from a straightforward analysis of the text of 1252(f)(1), as recognized by the Courts decision in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. ___ (2022).  But that is where the majority and I part ways. I agree with Justice Barrett that the majority should not go any further and should not resolve other questions about 1252(f)(1) without adequate briefing or argument.  The Government admits that this Court could in theory vacate the judgment below without reaching the merits, Supp. Brief for Petitioners 23, but the majority chooses to decide far more than is necessary or advisable under the circumstances. As Justice Barrett explains, the interpretation of 1252(f)(1) presents difficult questions that the parties should have addressed in the briefs they filed before oral argument.  In its opening brief, the Governments only discussion of this issue appeared in a footnote that reads as follows in its entirety: In addition, the lower courts lacked jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief under 8 U.S.C. []1252(f)(1). This Court is considering the scope of Section 1252(f)(1) in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, No. 20322 (argued Jan. 11, 2022).  Brief for Petitioners 18, n. 3. That footnotes reference to the Governments brief in Gonzalez raised an obvious question.  Section 1252(f)(1) refers to orders that enjoin or restrain the operation of specified statutory provisions, and in Gonzalez, the Government suggested that this provision should not be interpreted to apply only to injunctions.  Brief for Petitioners 1719, 32, n. 3, and Tr. of Oral Arg. 1516, in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, O. T. 2021, No. 20322.  Instead, the Government refused to rule out the possibility that the provision might also apply to class-wide declaratory relief, and it analogized 1252(f)(1) to the Tax Injunction Act,\n","\n","28 U.S.C. 1341, and cited our decision in California v. Grace Brethren Church,\n","\n","457 U.S. 393 (1982), which interpreted that provision in a practical sense.  Id., at 408. In the present case, the Government challenged the order of the District Court set[ting] aside under the APA,\n","\n","5 U.S.C. 706(2), the June termination of MPP, and since this order had a practical effect that was in some respects similar to an injunction, the Governments argument in Gonzalez raised the question whether the Government thought that 1252(f)(1) also barred the District Court from reviewing the termination of the MPP under the APA.  That is an important question the resolution of which could have effects extending far beyond this particular dispute, and at oral argument the Solicitor General took the far-reaching position that 1252(f)(1) does indeed bar APA review.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 1314.  But none of the papers filed by the Government in this case or in Gonzalez said one word about APA review.  Nor did the respondents brief.  Indeed, their brief did not discuss jurisdiction at all. Faced with this situation, the Court was correctly concerned about deciding the reach of 1252(f)(1) and the important APA question without any briefing.  The Court could haveand, in my judgment, should havedealt with this problem by deciding this case without saying anything about 1252(f)(1) other than that it bars injunctive relief.  Instead, with the end of the Term looming ahead, the Court directed the parties to brief these issues, but it gave them just one week to do so.  And as the Court should have anticipated, those briefs raised new questions that it would have been useful to explore at argument had that been held.  But determined to accommodate the Governments request that this case be decided this Term, the majority inadvisably plows ahead. I would not do so.  Because of the Governments request for a speedy decision, we established an expedited schedule for the filing of merits briefs and squeezed in oral argument on the next-to-last argument date.  We would have been in a position to give thorough consideration to the 1252(f)(1) issue if it had been addressed in the parties regular briefs, but having relegated the issue to a terse footnote in its brief, and having been unprepared to discuss the issue at argument, the Government is not entitled to any further special treatment.  We should simply vacate the decision below and remand for reconsideration in light of our decision in Gonzalez.[3]  Nothing more is either necessary or appropriate under the circumstances. III The Court is not only wrong to reach the merits of this case, but its analysis of the merits is seriously flawed.  First, the majority errs in holding that the INA does not really mean what it says when it commands that the aliens in question shall be detained pending removal or asylum proceedings unless they are either returned to Mexico or paroled on a case-by-case basis.  According to the majority, it is fine for DHS simply to release these aliens en masse and allow them to disappear.  Second, the majority improperly faults the Court of Appeals for refusing to allow the Government to derail the appellate process by a last-minute maneuver designed to thwart review of the manner in which it initially terminated MPP. A As described above, the INA gives DHS three options regarding the treatment of the aliens in question while they await removal or asylum proceedings.  They may be (1) detained in this country or (2) returned to Mexico or (3) paroled on a case-by-case basis.  Congress has provided no fourth option, but the majority now creates one.  According to the majority, an alien who cannot be detained due to a shortage of detention facilities but could be returned to Mexico may simply be released.  That is wrong. 1 The language of\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(A) is unequivocal.  With narrow exceptions that are inapplicable here,[4] it provides that every alien who is an applicant for admission and who the examining immigration officer determines ... is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted ... shall be detained for a [removal] proceeding.  (Emphasis added.)  Six years ago, the Government argued strenuously that this requirement is mandatory, and its brief could hardly have been more categorical or emphatic in making this point.  See Brief for Petitioners in Jennings v. Rodriguez, O. T. 2017, No. 151204, p. 15 (Aliens seeking admission who are not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted are statutorily prohibited from physically entering the United States and must be detained during removal proceedings ... , unless the Secretary exercises his discretion to release them on parole); id., at 17 (Unlike the word may, which implies discretion, the word shall usually connotes a requirement.  And here, the repeated shall be detained clearly means what it says (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). The Jennings Court correctly accepted that argument, which was central to our holding.  See 583 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (Read most naturally, 1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) thus mandate detention of applicants for admission until certain proceedings have concluded).  But now, in an about-face, the Government argues that shall be detained actually means may be detained.  See Brief for Petitioners 29 ([T]he Court will not construe a provision stating that law enforcement shall take some action as a true mandate absent some stronger indication from the ... Legislature). The Government was correct in Jennings and is wrong here.  [S]hall be detained means shall be detained.  The Government points out that it lacks the facilities to detain all the aliens in question, and no one questions that fact.  But use of the contiguous-return authority would at least reduce the number of aliens who are released in violation of the INAs command.  The District Court made a factual finding that rescinding MPP would cause additional violations of Congresss unambiguous detention mandate.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 851852.  It also found that the termination of MPP has contributed to the current border surge by giving aliens the perverse incentiv[e], id., at 837, App. 196, to cross the border illegally in hopes of being paroled and released.  Id., at 79.  Thus, the Government is failing to meet the statutory detention mandate, not only because of limitations on its detention capacity but also because it refuses to use the contiguous-territory return authority. Other than the argument that shall means may, the Governments only other textual argument is that it is paroling aliens on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit, as permitted under 1182(d)(5)(A).  But the number of aliens paroled each month under that provisionmore than 27,000 in April of this year[5]gives rise to a strong inference that the Government is not really making these decisions on a case-by-case basis.  The Government argues that respondents had the burden to show that it is not making case-by-case determinations and that they have not met that burden, see Brief for Petitioners 34, but information about the true nature of these proceedings is in the Governments possession, and it has revealed little about what actually takes place.  At argument, however, the Solicitor General argued that the case-by-case determination requirement can be met simply by going through a brief checklist for each alien.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5860.  Even the rudimentary step of verifying that an alien does not have a criminal record is not performed in every case.  Id., at 31.  Such procedures are inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of case-by-case review, and as the Court of Appeals pointed out, the circumstances under which 1182(d)(5)(B)) was adopted bolster that conclusion.  See 20 F. 4th, at 947 (After the executive branch on multiple occasions purported to use the parole power to bring in large groups of immigrants, Congress twice amended\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5) to limit the scope of the parole power and prevent the executive branch from using it as a programmatic policy tool (citing T. Aleinikoff etal., Immigration and Citizenship: Process and Policy 300 (9th ed. 2021))). The majority claims that the Governments use of its parole authority under 1182(d)(5)(A) is not before us, ante, at 18, but the Government cites that authority as a reason why it does not need to use its contiguous-territory return authority.  Brief for Petitioners 6, 3336. Moreover, the District Courts judgment relied on factual findings regarding DHSs abuse of its parole authority on the record that the Government provided.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 837. For these reasons, 1182(d)(5)(A) cannot justify the release of tens of thousands of apparently inadmissible aliens each month, and that leaves the Government with only one lawful option: continue to return inadmissible aliens to Mexico.  See 1225(b)(2)(C). 2 The majoritys chief defense of the Governments rejection of MPP is based on a blinkered method of statutory interpretation that we have firmly rejected.  The majority largely ignores the mandatory detention requirement imposed by 1225(b)(2)(A) and, instead, reads the contiguous-return provision, 1225(b)(2)(C), in isolation.  That provision says that the Secretary may return aliens to the country from which they entered, not that the Secretary must do so, and for the majority, that is enough to show that use of that authority is not required. That reading ignores the statutory structure of the INA, ante, at 14, and wrongly confine[s] itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation.  FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,\n","\n","529 U.S. 120, 132 (2000).  We have an obligation to read the INA as a coherent regulatory scheme.  Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,\n","\n","513 U.S. 561, 569 (1995); see also FTC v. Mandel Brothers, Inc.,\n","\n","359 U.S. 385, 389 (1959); Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U.S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 10); A. Scalia & G. Garner, Reading Law 180 (2012) (describing the harmonious-reading canon).  And if we follow that canon, the majoritys interpretation collapses. Read as a whole, the INA gives DHS discretion to choose from among only three options for handling the relevant category of inadmissible aliens.  The Government must either: (1) detain them, (2) return them to a contiguous foreign nation, or (3) parole them into the United States on an individualized, case-by-case basis.  These options operate in a hydraulic relationship: When it is not possible for the Government to comply with the statutory mandate to detain inadmissible aliens pending further proceedings, it must resort to one or both of the other two options in order to comply with the detention requirement to the greatest extent possible. There is nothing strange about this interpretation of how the relevant provisions of the INA work together.  Consider this example.  Suppose a state law provides that every school district shall provide a free public education to every student from kindergarten through the 12th grade and that another statute says that a district may arrange for its students to attend high school in an adjacent district.  A small district refuses to operate its own high school because it lacks the necessary funds, and this district also declines to arrange for its students to attend a school in an adjacent district because the law says only that a district may take that course of action.  Refusing to exercise this discretionary authority, the district throws up its hands and says to its high school students: Were sorry.  If you want to go to high school, you will have to make your own arrangements and foot the bill.  If those students sue, would any court sustain what the district did? Other examples come readily to mind.  Suppose that a building code says that every multi-unit residential building shall have at least two means of egress from upper floors, and suppose that another provision says that such a building may have an external fire escape.  The owner of such a building refuses to construct a second internal stairway because the cost would be prohibitive and also declines to install a fire escape because the law says that option is discretionary.  Would the owners non-compliance be permitted? Here is one more example.  A State that operates its own motor vehicle inspection facilities has a law that says that every vehicle shall be inspected every year.  The law also says that motorists may have their vehicles inspected at a licensed private garage.  A motorist fails to have his car inspected because he must work during the time when the state facility is open and would be fired if he took time off.  This motorist also declines to have his car inspected at a private garage that is open during his off hours because the law says only that he may use such a facility.  Would the motorist escape a citation? The answer in each of the above examples is that the failure to make use of the discretionary option would not be seen as a valid excuse for non-compliance with the command that certain conduct shall be performed, and it is also hard to see the difference between those examples and the situation here. 3 The majoritys main reason for rejecting the argument just described is that the contiguous-return provision does not say expressly that it was meant to operate as a mandatory cure of any non-compliance with the Governments detention obligations.  Ante, at 14.  But what logic compels need not be stated expressly. The majority also relies on the fact that the contiguous- return provision was enacted 90 years after the provision requiring detention and the fact that the circumstances under which the contiguous-return provision was adopted suggest that it was intended to serve only a humble role.  Ante, at 16.  Those circumstances cannot change what the relevant provisions say or the way in which they logically work together.  See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc.,\n","\n","545 U.S. 546, 568 (2005) (Extrinsic materials have a role in statutory interpretation only to the extent that they shed a reliable light on the enacting Legislatures understanding of otherwise ambiguous terms).  The Court should not use extra-textual evidence to demote one of DHSs three lawful alternatives to the status of a historical footnote. The majority and the concurrence fault the lower courts for intruding upon the foreign policy authority conferred on the President by Article II of the Constitution.  Ante, at 1617 (majority opinion); ante, at 3 (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.).  But enforcement of immigration laws often has foreign relations implications, and the Constitution gives Congress broad authority to set immigration policy.  See Art. I, 8, cl. 4.  This means, we have said, that [p]olicies pertaining to the entry of aliens are entrusted exclusively to Congress.  Galvan v. Press,\n","\n","347 U.S. 522, 531 (1954) (emphasis added).  The President has vital power in the field of foreign affairs, so does Congress, and the President does not have the authority to override immigration laws enacted by Congress.  Indeed, [w]hen the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter.  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,\n","\n","343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).  And it is Congress, not the Judiciary, that gave the Executive only three options for dealing with inadmissible aliens encountered at the border. Finally, the majority emphasizes the fact that prior administrations have also failed to detain inadmissible aliens, but that practice does not change what the law demands.  The majority cites no authority for the doctrine that the Executive can acquire authority forbidden by law through a process akin to adverse possession. B Not only does the majority fail to heed the clear language of the INA, but it gratuitously faults the Court of Appeals for what appears to be a fairly modest and correct conclusion: that the October 29 Memoranda purporting to re-terminate MPP did not ultimately affect the merits of the appeal of the judgment that was before that court.  The Government issued its October 29 Memoranda after briefing in the Court of Appeals had been completed and only days before the appeal was set to be argued.  Based on those memoranda, the Government asked the Court of Appeals to vacate the judgment below, but it did not provide a full administrative record or give the District Court an opportunity to review the purported new decision in the first instance by filing a Rule 60(b) motion.[6]  The majority now says that the Court of Appeals erred by failing to treat the October 29 Memoranda as a new, final agency action, but the majority does not say what applying that label would have required the Fifth Circuit to do differently. As I see it, the Governments litigation tacticfiling the October 29 Memoranda with a suggestion of mootness but without seeking to dismiss its appealcould have triggered one of four responses from the Court of Appeals.  The Court of Appeals could have (1) dismissed the appeal as moot and vacated the District Courts judgment and injunction; (2) held the appeal in abeyance for an unspecified time; (3) evaluated the October 29 Memoranda as final agency action in the first instance under the APA; or (4) concluded that the October 29 Memoranda did not affect the appeal, which challenged the June termination.  The Court of Appeals picked the fourth option, and taking each option in turn, I will explain why that was the response best suited to avoid derailing the ordinary appellate process. First, the October 29 Memoranda did not moot the appeal.  A case becomes moot only if it is impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief.  Chafin v. Chafin,\n","\n","568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013).  Under this high standard, the Fifth Circuit was correct that the case was not moot.  Although the Government claimed that the appeal was moot, it asked the Court of Appeals for relief, namely, vacatur of District Courts injunction.  It was compelled to take that position because the October 29 Memoranda, by their own terms, did not take effect as long as that injunction remained in force.  See 20 F. 4th, at 957.  And without an appellate decision holding that the INA allows the Government to release aliens who could be returned to Mexico, the issuance of a new administrative order terminating MPP could not provide a ground for vacating the injunction.  It is telling that the Governments briefing in this Court never suggests that the case was moot at the time of the Fifth Circuits decision or that the case is now moot. Second, the Court of Appeals did not err by declining to hold the appeal in abeyance.  The Government originally asked the Court of Appeals to hold the appeal while it completed the process of issuing a new termination decision, but by the time of oral argument in that court, the Government claimed that such a decision had been issued.  And the Government did not file a motion in the District Court to vacate its judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b).  The Government had sought to expedite proceedings at every stage, including by seeking emergency relief in the Fifth Circuit and this Court, and under these circumstances, it was eminently reasonable for the Court of Appeals to conclude that additional delay would not have served the interests of economy of time and effort.  Landis v. North American Co.,\n","\n","299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936). Third, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the October 29 Memoranda could not satisfy our criteria for a final agency action that could be reviewed in the first instance in the Court of Appeals under the APA.  Like this Court, the courts of appeal are courts of review, and not first view.  City of Austin v. Reagan Nat. Advertising of Austin, LLC, 596 U.S. ___, ______ (2022) (slip op., at 1314) (quoting Zivotofsky v. Clinton,\n","\n","566 U.S. 189, 201 (2012)).  With no administrative record for the October 29 Memoranda before it, the Court of Appeals was in a poor position to assess whether the memoranda actually mark[ed] the consummation of the agencys decisionmaking process, Bennett v. Spear,\n","\n","520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Moreover, the October 29 Memoranda did not purport to result in a final determination of rights or obligations.  Ibid.  As DHS acknowledged, the termination of MPP could not be implemented until there was a final judicial decision to vacate the ... injunction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 264a, 270a.  And until that was accomplished, the memoranda did not impose on DHS officers or employees any obligatio[n] to cease implementation of MPP.  Bennett, 520 U.S., at 178.  On this basis, the Fifth Circuit rightly understood that the October 29 Memoranda could have no legal effect while DHS was bound by an injunction to implement MPP in good faith and that this injunction would remain in force unless the Governments challenge to the June termination was decided in its favor.[7] Even if the Fifth Circuit had somehow concluded that the October 29 Memoranda constituted final agency action with some future legal consequences, the Court does not explain what the Fifth Circuit should have done differently in the circumstances it faced.  The Fifth Circuit had little ability to review whether the agency had acted reasonably.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,\n","\n","463 U.S. 29 (1983).  And the Fifth Circuit provided a reasonable explanation for its actions. With these three options off the table, the Fifth Circuit reasonably chose the fourth option.  It correctly concluded that the October 29 Memoranda did not affect its ability to review the District Court judgment.  To find fault with proceeding in that fashion, the majority seems to assume that an administrative agency may obviate a district court decision setting aside agency action under 706 of the APA by pursing the following course of conduct: first, appeal the district court decision; second, take a purportedly new action that achieves the same result as the one previously set aside; and third, while declining to seek vacatur of the earlier judgment in the district court, ask the court of appeals to vacate that judgment without reviewing its correctness or the lawfulness of the second action.  The Court of Appeals was correct to view this as an effort to thwart the normal appellate process. *** While I would affirm the Fifth Circuit if we reached the merits, I agree with the majority that the District Court on remand should consider in the first instance whether the October 29 Memoranda complied with 706 of the APA.  The District Court should assess, among other things, whether it is arbitrary and capricious for DHS to refuse to use its contiguous-territory return authority to avoid violations of the statutes clear detention mandate; whether the deterrent effect that DHS found MPP produced in reducing dangerous attempted illegal border crossings, as well as MPPs reduction of unmeritorious asylum claims, is adequately accounted for in the agencys new decision; and whether DHSs rescission of MPP is causing it to make parole decisions on an unlawful categorical basis rather than case-by-case, as the statute prescribes.\n","\n","tokenized_text: tensor([[    0, 18581,  3916,  ...,     9,     5,     2]]) 1024\n","\n","summary_ids: tensor([[    2,     0, 45621,  ..., 29185,     6,     2]]) 1024\n","\n","pred: Argued April 26, 2022Decided June 30, 2022 In January 2019, the Department of Homeland Security began to implement the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).  Under MPP, certain non-Mexican nationals arriving by land from Mexico with Mexico were returned to Mexico to await the results of their removal proceedings under section 1229a of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).  MPP was implemented pursuant to a provision of the INA that applies to aliens arriving on land... from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States and provides that the Secretary of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) may return the alien to that territory pending the outcome of a proceeding under the alien’s removal proceedings. See United States v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co.,200 U.S. 321, 337. 1225(b)(2)(C).  Following a change in Presidential administrations, the Biden administration announced that it would suspend the program, and on June 1, 2021, the Secretary for Homeland Security issued a memorandum officially terminating it.  The States of Texas and Missouri (respondents) brought suit in the Northern District of Texas against the Secretary and others, asserting that the June 1 Memorandum violated the InA and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  The District Court entered judgment for respondents.  It also imposed a nationwide injunction ordering the Government to enforce and implement MPP in good faith until such a time as it has been lawfully rescinded in compliance with the APA and until such as the federal government has sufficient detention capacity to detain all aliens subject to mandatory detention under [section 1225] without releasing any aliens because of a lack of detention resources.  20 F.Supp. 3d 818, 852.

In the District court, the court first concluded that terminating MPP would violate the INS Act, as it applies to illegal entrants.  Because the Government was unable to meet its mandatory detention obligations under section 120(a) and 1225 (b)(1)(A) due to resource constraints, the high court reasoned, that terminating the program would necessarily lead to the systemic violation of section 12 25 as illegal entrants were released into the UNITED States.  2 F.

Following a change in Presidential administrations, the Biden administration announced that it would suspend the program, and on June 1, 2021, the Secretary of Homeland Security issued a memorandum officially terminating it.  The States of Texas and Missouri (respondents) brought suit in the Northern District of Texas against the Secretary and others, asserting that the June 1 Memorandum violated the INA and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  The District Court entered judgment for respondents.  The court first concluded that terminating MPP would violate the INA, reasoning that section 1225 of the INA provides the government two options with respect to illegal entrants: mandatory detention pursuant to section 1225(b)(2)(A) or contiguous-territory return pursuant to section 1225(b)(2)(C).  554 F.Supp. 3d 818, 852.  Because the Government was unable to meet its mandatory detention obligations under section 1225(b)(2)(A) due to resource constraints, the court reasoned, terminating MPP would necessarily lead to the systemic violation of section 1225 as illegal entrants were released into the United States.  Second, the District Court concluded that the June 1 Memorandum was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.  The District Court vacated the June 1 Memorandum and remanded to DHS.  It also imposed a nationwide injunction ordering the Government to enforce and implement MPP in good faith until such a time as it has been lawfully rescinded in compliance with the APA and until such a time as the federal government has sufficient detention capacity to detain all aliens subject to mandatory detention under [section 1225] without releasing any aliens because of a lack of detention resources.  Id., at 857 (emphasis in original). While the Governments appeal was pending, the Secretary released the October 29 Memoranda, which again announced the termination of MPP and explained anew his reasons for doing so.  The Government then moved to vacate the injunction on the ground that the October 29 Memoranda had superseded the June 1 Memorandum.  But the Court of Appeals denied the motion and instead affirmed the District Courts judgment in full.  With respect to the INA question, the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Courts analysis that terminating the program would violate the INA, concluding that the return policy was mandatory so long as illegal entrants were being released into the United States.  The Court of Appeals also held that [t]he October 29 Memoranda did not constitute a new and separately reviewable final agency action.  20 F. 4th 928, 951.   Held:The Governments rescission of MPP did not violate section 1225 of the INA, and the October 29 Memoranda constituted final agency action.  Pp. 825. (a)Beginning with jurisdiction, the injunction that the District Court entered in this case violated\n","\n","8 U.S. C. 1252(f)(1).  See Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. ___, ___.  But section 1252(f)(1) does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction to reach the merits of an appeal even where a lower court enters a form of relief barred by that provision.  Section 1252(f)(1) withdraws a district courts jurisdiction or authority to grant a particular form of relief.  It does not deprive lower courts of all subject matter jurisdiction over claims brought under sections 1221 through 1232 of the INA.   The text of the provision makes that clear.  Section 1252(f)(1) deprives courts of the power to issue a specific category of remedies: those that enjoin or restrain the operation of the relevant sections of the statute.  And Congress included that language in a provision whose titleLimit on injunctive reliefmakes clear the narrowness of its scope.  Moreover, the provision contains a parenthetical that explicitly preserves this Courts power to enter injunctive relief.  If section 1252(f)(1) deprived lower courts of subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate any non-individual claims under sections 1221 through 1232, no such claims could ever arrive at this Court, rendering the specific carveout for Supreme Court injunctive relief nugatory. Statutory structure likewise confirms this conclusion.  Elsewhere in section 1252, where Congress intended to deny subject matter jurisdiction over a particular class of claims, it did so unambiguously.  See, e.g., 1252(a)(2) (entitled Matters not subject to judicial review).  Finally, this Court previously encountered a virtually identical situation in Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. ___, and proceeded to reach the merits of the suit notwithstanding the District Courts apparent violation of section 1252(f)(1).  Pp.813. (b)Turning to the merits, section 1225(b)(2)(C) provides: In the case of an alien ... who is arriving on land ... from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States, the [Secretary] may return the alien to that territory pending a proceeding under section 1229a.  Section 1225(b)(2)(C) plainly confers a discretionary authority to return aliens to Mexico.  This Court has repeatedly observed that the word may clearly connotes discretion.  Opati v. Republic of Sudan, 590 U.S. ___, ___.   Respondents and the Court of Appeals concede that point, but urge an inference from the statutory structure: because section 1225(b)(2)(A) makes detention mandatory, they argue, the otherwise-discretionary return authority in section 1225(b)(2)(C) becomes mandatory when the Secretary violates that mandate.  The problem is that the statute does not say anything like that.  The statute says may.  If Congress had intended section 1225(b)(2)(C) to operate as a mandatory cure of any noncompliance with the Governments detention obligations, it would not have conveyed that intention through an unspoken inference in conflict with the unambiguous, express term may.  The contiguous-territory return authority in section 1225(b)(2)(C) is discretionaryand remains discretionary notwithstanding any violation of section 1225(b)(2)(A).   The historical context in which section 1225(b)(2)(C) was adopted confirms the plain import of its text.  Section 1225(b)(2)(C) was added to the statute more than 90 years after the shall be detained language that appears in section 1225(b)(2)(A).  And the provision was enacted in response to a BIA decision that had questioned the legality of the contiguous-territory return practice.  Moreover, since its enactment, every Presidential administration has interpreted section 1225(b)(2)(C) as purely discretionary, notwithstanding the consistent shortfall of funds to comply with section 1225(b)(2)(A).   The foreign affairs consequences of mandating the exercise of contiguous-territory return likewise confirm that the Court of Appeals erred.  Interpreting section 1225(b)(2)(C) as a mandate imposes a significant burden upon the Executives ability to conduct diplomatic relations with Mexico, one that Congress likely did not intend section 1225(b)(2)(C) to impose.  And finally, the availability of parole as an alternative means of processing applicants for admission, see\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A), additionally makes clear that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the INA required the Government to continue implementing MPP.  Pp. 1318. (c)The Court of Appeals also erred in holding that [t]he October 29 Memoranda did not constitute a new and separately reviewable final agency action.  20 F. 4th, at 951.  Once the District Court vacated the June 1 Memorandum and remanded to DHS for further consideration, DHS had two options: elaborate on its original reasons for taking action or deal with the problem afresh by taking new agency action.  Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. ___, ___.  The Secretary selected the second option from Regents: He accepted the District Courts vacatur and dealt with the problem afresh.  The October 29 Memoranda were therefore final agency action for the same reasons that the June 1 Memorandum was final agency action: Both mark[ed] the consummation of the agencys decisionmaking process and resulted in rights and obligations [being] determined.  Bennett v. Spear,\n","\n","520 U.S. 154, 178.   The various rationales offered by respondents and the Court of Appeals in support of the contrary conclusion lack merit.  First, the Court of Appeals erred to the extent it understood itself to be reviewing an abstract decision apart from the specific agency actions contained in the June 1 Memorandum and October 29 Memoranda.  Second, and relatedly, the October 29 Memoranda were not a mere posthoc rationalization of the June 1 Memorandum.  The prohibition on posthoc rationalization applies only when the agency proceeds by the first option from Regents.  Here, the Secretary chose the second option from Regents and issue[d] a new rescission bolstered by new reasons absent from the [June 1] Memorandum.  591 U.S., at ___.  Having returned to the drawing table, the Secretary was not subject to the charge of posthoc rationalization.   Third, respondents invoke Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. ___.  But nothing in this record suggests a significant mismatch between the decision the Secretary made and the rationale he provided.  Id., at ___.  Relatedly, the Court of Appeals charged that the Secretary failed to proceed with a sufficiently open mind.  But this Court has previously rejected criticisms of agency closemindedness based on an identity between proposed and final agency action.  See Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 591 U.S. ___, ___.  Finally, the Court of Appeals erred to the extent it viewed the Governments decision to appeal the District Courts injunction as relevant to the question of the October 29 Memorandas status as final agency action.  Nothing prevents an agency from undertaking new agency action while simultaneously appealing an adverse judgment against its original action.  Pp.1825. 20 F.4th 928, reversed and remanded.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21954 _________________ JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, etal., PETITIONERS v. TEXAS, etal. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit [June 30, 2022]  Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court. In January 2019, the Department of Homeland Securityunder the administration of President Trumpestablished the Migrant Protection Protocols.  That program provided for the return to Mexico of non-Mexican aliens who had been detained attempting to enter the United States illegally from Mexico.  On Inauguration Day 2021, the new administration of President Biden announced that the program would be suspended the next day, and later that year sought to terminate it.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals, however, held that doing so would violate the Immigration and Nationality Act, concluding that the return policy was mandatory so long as illegal entrants were being released into the United States.  The District Court also held that the attempted rescission of the program was inadequately explained in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.  While its appeal was pending, the Government took new action to terminate the policy with a more detailed explanation.  But the Court of Appeals held that this new action was not separately reviewable final agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act. The questions presented are whether the Governments rescission of the Migrant Protection Protocols violated the Immigration and Nationality Act and whether the Governments second termination of the policy was a valid final agency action. I A On December 20, 2018, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen announced a new program called Remain in Mexico, also known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).  MPP was created in response to an immigration surge at the countrys southern border, and a resulting humanitarian and border security crisis in which federal immigration officials were encountering approximately 2,000 inadmissible aliens each day.  554 F.Supp. 3d 818, 831 (ND Tex. 2021).  MPP provided that certain non-Mexican nationals arriving by land from Mexico would be returned to Mexico to await the results of their removal proceedings under\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1229a.  On the same day that Secretary Nielsen announced the program, the Government of Mexico agreed that it would cooperate in administering it, on a temporary basis. MPP was implemented pursuant to express congressional authorization in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which provides that [i]n the case of an alien ... who is arriving on land (whether or not at a designated port of arrival) from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States, the Attorney General may return the alien to that territory pending a proceeding under section 1229a of this title.\n","\n","66Stat.\n","163, as added and amended,\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C).[1]  Prior to the initiation of MPP, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its predecessor agency had primarily used [1225(b)(2)(C)] on an ad-hoc basis to return certain Mexican and Canadian nationals arriving at ports of entry.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 273a, n.12. A separate provision of the same section of the INA states that if an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a proceeding under section 1229a of this title.  1225(b)(2)(A).  Due to consistent and significant funding shortfalls, however, DHS has never had sufficient detention capacity to maintain in custody every single person described in section 1225.  Id., at 323a.  In light of that fact, the Trump administration chose to implement MPP in part so that [c]ertain aliens attempting to enter the U.S. illegally or without documentation, including those who claim asylum, will no longer be released into the country, where they often fail to file an asylum application and/or disappear before an immigration judge can determine the merits of any claim.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 832. In January 2019, DHS began implementing MPP, initially in San Diego, California, then in El Paso, Texas, and Calexico, California, and then nationwide.  By December 31, 2020, DHS had enrolled 68,039 aliens in the program. Following the change in Presidential administrations, however, the Biden administration sought to terminate the program.  On January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security wrote that [e]ffective January 21, 2021, the Department will suspend new enrollments in [MPP] pending further review of the program.  Aliens who are not already enrolled in MPP should be processed under other existing legal authorities.  Id., at 836.  President Biden also issued Executive Order No. 14010, which directed the new Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, to promptly review and determine whether to terminate or modify the [MPP] program.  86 Fed. Reg. 8269 (2021). On June 1, 2021, Secretary Mayorkas issued a memorandum officially terminating MPP (the June 1 Memorandum).  In that memorandum, the Secretary noted his determination that MPP [d]oes not adequately or sustainably enhance border management in such a way as to justify the programs extensive operational burdens and other shortfalls.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 351a.  He also emphasized that, since its inception, MPP had played an outsized role in [DHSs] engagement with the Government of Mexico, given the significant attention that it draws away from other elements that necessarily must be more central to the bilateral relationship.  Id., at 357a.  For those and other reasons, the Secretary announced that he was by this memorandum terminating the MPP program, and direct[ed] DHS personnel to take all appropriate actions to terminate MPP, including taking all steps necessary to rescind implementing guidance and other directives or policy guidance issued to implement the program.  Id., at 348a349a. B On April 13, 2021, the States of Texas and Missouri (respondents) initiated this lawsuit in the Northern District of Texas against Secretary Mayorkas and others.  Respondents initial complaint challenged the Acting Secretarys January 20 suspension of new enrollments in MPP, but following the June 1 Memorandum, they amended their complaint to challenge the Secretarys June 1 rescission of the entire program.  The amended complaint asserted that the June 1 Memorandum violated the INA and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),\n","\n","5 U.S.C. 701 etseq., and sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and vacatur of the rescission pursuant to the APA. The District Court conducted a one-day bench trial and entered judgment for respondents.  The court first concluded that terminating MPP would violate the INA.  It reasoned that section 1225 of the INA provides the government two options: mandatory detention pursuant to section 1225(b)(2)(A) or contiguous-territory return pursuant to section 1225(b)(2)(C).  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 852.  Because the Government was unable to meet its detention obligations under section 1225(b)(2)(A) due to resource constraints, the court concluded, terminating MPP necessarily leads to the systemic violation of Section 1225 as aliens are released into the United States.  Ibid.  Second, the District Court found that the agency failed to engage in reasoned decisionmaking and therefore acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the APA.  Id., at 847851. Based on these conclusions, the District Court vacated [the June 1 Memorandum] in its entirety and remanded to DHS for further consideration.  Id., at 857 (boldface and capitalization omitted).  And it imposed a nationwide injunction ordering the Government to enforce and implement MPP in good faith until such a time as it has been lawfully rescinded in compliance with the APA and until such a time as the federal government has sufficient detention capacity to detain all aliens subject to mandatory detention under [section 1225] without releasing any aliens because of a lack of detention resources.  Ibid. (emphasis in original). The Government appealed and sought a stay of the injunction, which the District Court and the Court of Appeals each denied.  The Government then applied to this Court for a stay.  The Court denied the application, finding that the Government had failed to show a likelihood of success on the claim that the [June 1 Memorandum] was not arbitrary and capricious.  594 U.S. ___ (2021).  The Court did not address the District Courts interpretation of the INA. The parties proceeded to briefing in the Court of Appeals.  While the Governments appeal was pending, however, Secretary Mayorkas considered anew whether to maintain, terminate, or modify MPP in various ways.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 286a.  On September 29, 2021, the Secretary publicly announced his inten[tion] to issue in the coming weeks a new memorandum terminating [MPP].  20 F. 4th 928, 954 (CA5 2021).  The Government then moved to hold the appeal in abeyance pending the Secretarys formal decision, but the Court of Appeals denied the motion. On October 29, the Secretary released a four-page memorandum that again announced the termination of MPP, along with a 39-page addendum explaining his reasons for doing so (the October 29 Memoranda).  As the Secretary explained, this new assessment of MPP examined considerations that the District Court determined were insufficiently addressed in the June 1 memo, including claims that MPP discouraged unlawful border crossings, decreased the filing of non-meritorious asylum claims, and facilitated more timely relief for asylum seekers, as well as predictions that termination of MPP would lead to a border surge, cause [DHS] to fail to comply with alleged detention obligations under the [INA], impose undue costs on states, and put a strain on U.S.-Mexico relations.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 259a260a. The Secretary acknowledged what he called the strongest argument in favor of retaining MPP: namely, the significant decrease in border encounters following the determination to implement MPP across the southern border.  Id., at 261a.  But he nonetheless concluded that the programs benefits do not justify the costs, particularly given the way in which MPP detracts from other regional and domestic goals, foreign-policy objectives, and domestic policy initiatives that better align with this Administrations values.  Ibid.  Finally, the Secretary once again noted that [e]fforts to implement MPP have played a particularly outsized role in diplomatic engagements with Mexico, diverting attention from more productive efforts to fight transnational criminal and smuggling networks and address the root causes of migration.  Id., at 262a. In light of those conclusions, the Secretary announced that he was once again hereby terminating MPP.  Id., at 263a.  He explained that DHS would continue complying with the [District Courts] injunction requiring good-faith implementation and enforcement of MPP.  Id., at 264a.  But he noted that the termination of MPP would be implemented as soon as practicable after a final judicial decision to vacate that injunction.  Ibid.  The Government then moved to vacate the injunction on the ground that the October 29 Memoranda had superseded the June 1 Memorandum, but the Court of Appeals denied the motion. The Court of Appeals instead affirmed the District Courts judgment in full.  With respect to the INA question, the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Courts analysis of the relevant provisions.  That is, the court explained, section 1225(b)(2)(A) sets forth a general, plainly obligatory rule: detention for aliens seeking admission, while section 1225(b)(2)(C) authorizes contiguous-territory return as an alternative.  20 F. 4th, at 996.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals reasoned, DHS is violating (A)s mandate, refusing to avail itself of (C)s authorized alternative, and then complaining that it doesnt like its options.  Ibid., n.18. The Court of Appeals also held that [t]he October 29 Memoranda did not constitute a new and separately reviewable final agency action.  Id., at 951.  The Court of Appeals distinguished DHSs June 1 decision to terminate MPP, which it claimed had legal effect, from the June 1 Memorandum, the October 29 Memoranda, and any other subsequent memos, which it held simply explained DHSs decision.  Ibid.  The Court of Appeals then criticized the Government for proceeding without a hint of an intention to put the Termination Decision back on the chopping block and rethink things, and for ultimately just further defend[ing] what it had previously decided.  Id., at 955.  And the Court of Appeals drew a dichotomy between taking new agency action and appealing an adverse decision, asserting that DHS chose not to take a new agency action but instead chose to notice an appeal and defend its Termination Decision in our court.  Id., at 941. We granted certiorari, 595 U.S. ___ (2022), and expedited consideration of this appeal at the Governments request. II We begin with jurisdiction.  The Government contends that the injunction the District Court entered was barred by\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1252(f)(1).  That provision reads as follows: Regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party or parties bringing the action, no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of [8 U.S.C. 12211232], other than with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under [those provisions] have been initiated. As we recently held in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. ___ (2022), section 1252(f)(1) generally prohibits lower courts from entering injunctions that order federal officials to take or to refrain from taking actions to enforce, implement, or otherwise carry out the specified statutory provisions.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  The District Courts injunction in this case violated that provision.  But that fact simply presents us with the following question: whether section 1252(f)(1) deprives this Court of jurisdiction to reach the merits of an appeal, where the lower court entered a form of relief barred by that provision.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment,\n","\n","523 U.S. 83, 95 (1998) (Every federal appellate court has an obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review, even though the parties are prepared to concede it. (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). Absent section 1252(f)(1), the District Court clearly had federal question jurisdiction over respondents suit, which asserted claims arising under two federal statutes, the INA and the APA.  See\n","\n","28 U.S.C. 1331 (The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.).  The question, then, is whether section 1252(f)(1) strips the lower courts of subject matter jurisdiction over these claims.  The parties agree that the answer to that question is no, and so do we.  That is because section 1252(f)(1) withdraws a district courts jurisdiction or authority to grant a particular form of relief.  It does not deprive the lower courts of all subject matter jurisdiction over claims brought under sections 1221 through 1232 of the INA. The text of the provision makes that clear.  Section 1252(f)(1) deprives courts of the power to issue a specific category of remedies: those that enjoin or restrain the operation of the relevant sections of the statute.  A limitation on subject matter jurisdiction, by contrast, restricts a courts power to adjudicate a case.  United States v. Cotton,\n","\n","535 U.S. 625, 630 (2002).  Section 1252(f)(1) bears no indication that lower courts lack power to hear any claim brought under sections 1221 through 1232.  If Congress had wanted the provision to have that effect, it could have said so in words far simpler than those that it wrote.  But Congress instead provided that lower courts would lack jurisdiction to enjoin or restrain the operation of the relevant provisions, and it included that language in a provision whose titleLimit on injunctive reliefmakes clear the narrowness of its scope. A second feature of the text of section 1252(f)(1) leaves no doubt that this Court has jurisdiction: the parenthetical explicitly preserving this Courts power to enter injunctive relief.  See 1252(f)(1) ([N]o court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority ...).  If section 1252(f)(1) deprived lower courts of subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate any non-individual claims under sections 1221 through 1232, no such claims could ever arrive at this Court, rendering the provisions specific carveout for Supreme Court injunctive relief nugatory.  Indeed, that carveout seems directed at precisely the question before us here: whether section 1252(f)(1)s [l]imit on injunctive relief has any consequence for the jurisdiction of this Court.  Congress took pains to answer that question in the negative.  Interpreting section 1252(f)(1) to deprive this Court of jurisdiction under these circumstances would therefore fail to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of [the] statute.  Williams v. Taylor,\n","\n","529 U.S. 362, 404 (2000).[2] Statutory structure confirms our conclusion.  Elsewhere in section 1252, where Congress intended to deny subject matter jurisdiction over a particular class of claims, it did so unambiguously.  Section 1252(a)(2), for instance, is entitled Matters not subject to judicial review and provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review several categories of decisions, such as any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense....  (Emphasis added.)  Congress could easily have added one more item to this list: any action taken pursuant to sections 1221 through 1232.  Or it could have worded section 1252(f)(1) similarly to the immediately adjacent section 1252(g), which provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against [the alien].  (Emphasis added.)  But Congress did neither.  Instead, it constructed a carefully worded provision depriving the lower courts of power to enjoin or restrain the operation of certain sections of the statute, and it entitled that provision a [l]imit on injunctive relief. Our prior cases have already embraced this straightforward conclusion.  Most relevantly, the Court previously encountered a virtually identical situation in Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. ___ (2019).  There, as here, the plaintiffs sought declaratory as well as injunctive relief in their complaint, and there, as here, the District Court awarded only the latter.  Yet this Court proceeded to reach the merits of the suit, notwithstanding the District Courts apparent violation of section 1252(f)(1), by reasoning that [w]hether the [District] [C]ourt had jurisdiction to enter such an injunction is irrelevant because the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs request for declaratory relief.  Id., at ______ (Alito, J., joined by Roberts, C. J., and Kavanaugh, J.) (slip op., at 89); see also Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. ___, ___ (2018) (Breyer, J., joined by Ginsburg and Sotomayor, JJ., dissenting) (slip op., at 31) (concluding that a court could order declaratory relief notwithstanding section 1252(f)(1)).  Our disposition in Preap is inconsistent with an interpretation of the limitation in section 1252(f)(1) that strips the lower courts of subject matter jurisdiction.[3]  And previous statements from this Court regarding section 1252(f)(1) are in accord.  See Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm.,\n","\n","525 U.S. 471, 481 (1999) (By its plain terms, and even by its title, [section 1252(f)(1)] is nothing more or less than a limit on injunctive relief.). In short, we see no basis for the conclusion that section 1252(f)(1) concerns subject matter jurisdiction.  It is true that section 1252(f)(1) uses the phrase jurisdiction or authority, rather than simply the word authority.  But [j]urisdiction ... is a word of many, too many meanings.  Steel Co., 523 U.S., at 90.  And the question whether a court has jurisdiction to grant a particular remedy is different from the question whether it has subject matter jurisdiction over a particular class of claims.  See Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick,\n","\n","559 U.S. 154, 163164 (2010) (concluding that [t]he word jurisdiction ... says nothing about whether a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate claims).  Section 1252(f)(1) no doubt deprives the lower courts of jurisdiction to grant classwide injunctive relief.  See Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  But that limitation poses no obstacle to jurisdiction in this Court.[4] III We now turn to the merits.  Section 1225(b)(2)(C) provides: In the case of an alien ... who is arriving on land ... from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States, the [Secretary] may return the alien to that territory pending a proceeding under section 1229a.  Section 1225(b)(2)(C) plainly confers a discretionary authority to return aliens to Mexico during the pendency of their immigration proceedings.  This Court has repeatedly observed that the word may clearly connotes discretion.  Opati v. Republic of Sudan, 590 U.S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 10) (emphasis in original); see also, e.g., Weyerhaeuser Co. v. United States Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U.S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 14); Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,\n","\n","543 U.S. 335, 346 (2005).  The use of the word may in section 1225(b)(2)(C) thus makes clear that contiguous-territory return is a tool that the Secretary has the authority, but not the duty, to use.  Lopez v. Davis,\n","\n","531 U.S. 230, 241 (2001). Respondents and the Court of Appeals concede this point.  Brief for Respondents 21 (contiguous-territory return is a discretionary authority); 20 F. 4th, at 996, n.18 (Its obviously true that 1225(b)(2)(C) is discretionary.).  They base their interpretation instead on section 1225(b)(2)(A), which provides that, in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a proceeding under section 1229a of this title.  Respondents and the Court of Appeals thus urge an inference from the statutory structure: Because section 1225(b)(2)(A) makes detention mandatory, they argue, the otherwise-discretionary return authority in section 1225(b)(2)(C) becomes mandatory when the Secretary violates that detention mandate.   The problem is that the statute does not say anything like that.  The statute says may.  And may does not just suggest discretion, it clearly connotes it.  Opati, 590 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (emphasis in original); see also Jama, 543 U.S., at 346 (That connotation is particularly apt where, as here, may is used in contraposition to the word shall.).  Congresss use of the word may is therefore inconsistent with respondents proposed inference from the statutory structure.  If Congress had intended section 1225(b)(2)(C) to operate as a mandatory cure of any noncompliance with the Governments detention obligations, it would not have conveyed that intention through an unspoken inference in conflict with the unambiguous, express term may.  It would surely instead have coupled that grant of discretion with some indication of its sometimes-mandatory natureperhaps by providing that the Secretary may return certain aliens to Mexico, unless the government fails to comply with its detention obligations, in which case the Secretary must return them.  The statutory grant of discretion here contains no such caveat, and we will not rewrite it to include one.  See id., at 341 (We do not lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply.). The principal dissent emphasizes that section 1225(b)(2)(A) requires detention of all aliens that fall within its terms.  See, e.g., post, at 8 (Alito, J., dissenting) (The language of\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(A) is unequivocal.).  While the Government contests that proposition, we assume arguendo for purposes of this opinion that the dissents interpretation of section 1225(b)(2)(A) is correct, and that the Government is currently violating its obligations under that provision.[5]  Even so, the dissents conclusions regarding section 1225(b)(2)(C) do not follow.  Under the actual text of the statute, Justice Alitos interpretation is practically self-refuting.  He emphasizes that [s]hall be detained means shall be detained, post, at 9, and criticizes the Governments argument that shall means may, post, at 10.  But the theory works both ways.  Congress conferred contiguous-territory return authority in expressly discretionary terms.  [M]ay return the alien means may return the alien. The desire to redress the Governments purported violation of section 1225(b)(2)(A) does not justify transforming the nature of the authority conferred by section 1225(b)(2)(C).[6] The historical context in which the provision was adopted confirms the plain import of its text.  See, e.g., Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 U.S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 9) (textual analysis confirmed by a wider look at [the statutes] structure and history).  Section 1225(b)(2)(C) was not added to the statute until 1996, in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 302,\n","\n","110Stat.\n","300583more than 90 years after the Immigration Act of 1903 added the shall be detained language that appears in section 1225(b)(2)(A).  And section 1225(b)(2)(C) was enacted in the immediate aftermath of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision that specifically called into question the legality of the contiguous-territory return practice.  Prior to that decision, the longstanding practice of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) had been to require some aliens arriving at land border ports of entry to await their exclusion proceedings in Canada or Mexico.  The BIA noted the lack of any evidence that this is a practice known to Congress and the absence of a supporting regulation.  Inre Sanchez-Avila, 21 I. & N. Dec. 444, 465 (1996) (en banc).  Congress responded mere months later by adding section 1225(b)(2)(C) to IIRIRA and conferring on the Secretary express authority (may) to engage in the very practice that the BIA had questioned.  And INS acknowledged that clarification shortly thereafter, explaining that section 1225(b)(2)(C) and its implementing regulation simply add[] to the statute and regulation a long-standing practice of the Service.  62 Fed. Reg. 445 (1997).  That modest backstory suggests a more humble role for section 1225(b)(2)(C) than as a mandatory safety valve for any alien who is not detained under section 1225(b)(2)(A). In addition to contradicting the statutory text and context, the novelty of respondents interpretation bears mention.  Since IIRIRAs enactment 26 years ago, every Presidential administration has interpreted section 1225(b)(2)(C) as purely discretionary.  Indeed, at the time of IIRIRAs enactment and in the decades since, congressional funding has consistently fallen well short of the amount needed to detain all land-arriving inadmissible aliens at the border, yet no administration has ever used section 1225(b)(2)(C) to return all such aliens that it could not otherwise detain. And the foreign affairs consequences of mandating the exercise of contiguous-territory return likewise confirm that the Court of Appeals erred.  Article II of the Constitution authorizes the Executive to engag[e] in direct diplomacy with foreign heads of state and their ministers.  Zivotofsky v. Kerry,\n","\n","576 U.S. 1, 14 (2015).  Accordingly, the Court has taken care to avoid the danger of unwarranted judicial interference in the conduct of foreign policy, and declined to run interference in [the] delicate field of international relations without the affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed.  Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.,\n","\n","569 U.S. 108, 115116 (2013).  That is no less true in the context of immigration law, where [t]he dynamic nature of relations with other countries requires the Executive Branch to ensure that enforcement policies are consistent with this Nations foreign policy.  Arizona v. United States,\n","\n","567 U.S. 387, 397 (2012). By interpreting section 1225(b)(2)(C) as a mandate, the Court of Appeals imposed a significant burden upon the Executives ability to conduct diplomatic relations with Mexico.  MPP applies exclusively to non-Mexican nationals who have arrived at ports of entry that are located in the United States.  1225(a)(1).  The Executive therefore cannot unilaterally return these migrants to Mexico.  In attempting to rescind MPP, the Secretary emphasized that [e]fforts to implement MPP have played a particularly outsized role in diplomatic engagements with Mexico, diverting attention from more productive efforts to fight transnational criminal and smuggling networks and address the root causes of migration.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 262a.  Yet under the Court of Appeals interpretation, section 1225(b)(2)(C) authorized the District Court to force the Executive to the bargaining table with Mexico, over a policy that both countries wish to terminate, and to supervise its continuing negotiations with Mexico to ensure that they are conducted in good faith.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 857 (emphasis deleted).  That stark consequence confirms our conclusion that Congress did not intend section 1225(b)(2)(C) to tie the hands of the Executive in this manner. Finally, we note thatas DHS explained in its October 29 Memorandathe INA expressly authorizes DHS to process applicants for admission under a third option: parole.  See\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A).  Every administration, including the Trump and Biden administrations, has utilized this authority to some extent.  Importantly, the authority is not unbounded: DHS may exercise its discretion to parole applicants only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.  Ibid.  And under the APA, DHSs exercise of discretion within that statutory framework must be reasonable and reasonably explained.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,\n","\n","463 U.S. 29 (1983).  But the availability of the parole option additionally makes clear that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the INA required the Government to continue implementing MPP. In sum, the contiguous-territory return authority in section 1225(b)(2)(C) is discretionaryand remains discretionary notwithstanding any violation of section 1225(b)(2)(A).  To reiterate: we need not and do not resolve the parties arguments regarding whether section 1225(b)(2)(A) must be read in light of traditional principles of law enforcement discretion, and whether the Government is lawfully exercising its parole authorities pursuant to sections 1182(d)(5) and 1226(a).  We merely hold that section 1225(b)(2)(C) means what it says: may means may, and the INA itself does not require the Secretary to continue exercising his discretionary authority under these circumstances. IV The Court of Appeals also erred in holding that [t]he October 29 Memoranda did not constitute a new and separately reviewable final agency action.  20 F. 4th, at 951.  To recap, the Secretary first attempted to terminate MPP through the June 1 Memorandum.  As the Court of Appeals correctly held, that constituted final agency action.  See id., at 947 (citing Bennett v. Spear,\n","\n","520 U.S. 154 (1997)).  But the District Court found that the Secretarys stated grounds in the June 1 Memorandum were inadequate, and therefore vacated the June 1 Memorandum and remanded [the matter] to DHS for further consideration.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 857. As we explained two Terms ago in Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. ___ (2020), upon finding that the grounds for agency action are inadequate, a court may remand for the agency to do one of two things.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  First, the agency can offer a fuller explanation of the agencys reasoning at the time of the agency action.  Ibid. (emphasis deleted).  If it chooses this route, the agency may elaborate on its initial reasons for taking the action, but may not provide new ones.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  Alternatively, the agency can deal with the problem afresh by taking new agency action.  Ibid. (quoting SEC v. Chenery Corp.,\n","\n","332 U.S. 194, 201 (1947) (Chenery II)).  An agency taking this route is not limited to its prior reasons.  Regents, 591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 14). Here, perhaps in light of this Courts previous determination that the Government had failed to show a likelihood of success on the claim that the [June 1 Memorandum] was not arbitrary and capricious, 594 U.S. ___, the Secretary selected the second option from Regents: He accepted the District Courts vacatur and dealt with the problem afresh.  The October 29 Memoranda made that clear by its own terms, Regents, 591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 14), in which the Secretary stated: I am hereby terminating MPP.  Effective immediately, I hereby supersede and rescind the June 1 memorandum.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 263a264a.  And consistent with that approach, the October 29 Memoranda offered several new reasons absent from the June 1 Memorandum, Regents, 591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 14), including an examination of the considerations that the District Court determined were insufficiently addressed in the June 1 memo, App. to Pet. for Cert. 259a. The October 29 Memoranda were therefore final agency action for the same reasons that the June 1 Memorandum was final agency action.  That is, both the June 1 Memorandum and the October 29 Memoranda, when they were issued, mark[ed] the consummation of the agencys decisionmaking process and resulted in rights and obligations [being] determined.  Bennett, 520 U.S., at 178.  As the Court of Appeals explained, the June 1 Memorandum bound DHS staff by forbidding them to continue the program in any way from that moment on.  20 F. 4th, at 947.  That rationale also applies to the October 29 Memoranda, which were therefore final agency action under the APA.[7] The various rationales offered by respondents and the Court of Appeals in support of the contrary conclusion lack merit.[8]  First, the Court of Appeals framed the question by postulating the existence of an agency decision wholly apart from any agency statement of general or particular applicability ... designed to implement that decision.  5    U.S.C. 551(4); see 20 F. 4th, at 950951 (The States are challenging the Termination Decisionnot the June 1 Memorandum, the October 29 Memoranda, or any other memo.).  To the extent that the Court of Appeals understood itself to be reviewing an abstract decision apart from specific agency action, as defined in the APA, that was error.  It was not the case that the June 1 Memorandum and the October 29 Memoranda simply explained DHSs decision, while only the decision itself had legal effect.  Id., at 951.  To the contrary, the June 1 Memorandum and the October 29 Memoranda were themselves the operative agency actions, each of them an agency statement ... designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.\n","\n","5 U.S.C. 551(4). Second, and relatedly, respondents characterized the October 29 Memoranda as posthoc rationalizations of the June 1 Memorandum under our decision in Regents.  Brief for Respondents 40 ([T]he [October 29] Memoranda are nothing more than improper, posthoc rationalizations for terminating MPP.); see also 20 F. 4th, at 961 (questioning how the October 29 Memoranda [could] be anything more than posthoc rationalizations of the Termination Decision).  But Regents involved the exact opposite situation from this one.  There, as here, DHS had attempted to rescind a prior administrations immigration policy, but a District Court found the rescission inadequately explained.  Faced with the same two options outlined above, then- Secretary Nielsen elected the first option rather than the second.  That is, she chose to rest on the [original] Memorandum while elaborating on [her] prior reasoning, rather than issue a new rescission bolstered by new reasons absent from the [original] Memorandum.  591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  As such, her elaboration was limited to the agencys original reasons, and was viewed critically to ensure that the rescission [was] not upheld on the basis of impermissible posthoc rationalization.  Id., at ______ (slip op., at 1415).  And because the then-Secretarys reasoning had little relationship to that of her predecessor, the Court characterized the new explanations as impermissible posthoc rationalizations ... not properly before us.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15). The prohibition on posthoc rationalization applies only when the agency proceeds by the first option from Regents.  Under that circumstance, because the agency has chosen to rest on [its original action] while elaborating on its prior reasoning, id., at ___ (slip op., at 14), the bar on posthoc rationalization operates to ensure that the agencys supplemental explanation is anchored to the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the action, Michigan v. EPA,\n","\n","576 U.S. 743, 758 (2015).  By contrast, as noted above, the Secretary here chose the second option from Regents, and deal[t] with the problem afresh by taking new agency action.  591 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  That second option can be more procedurally onerous than the firstthe agency must comply with the procedural requirements for new agency actionbut the benefit is that the agency is not limited to its prior reasons in justifying its decision.  Ibid.  Indeed, the entire purpose of the October 29 Memoranda was for the Secretary to issue a new rescission bolstered by new reasons absent from the [June 1] Memorandum, ibid.reasons that he hoped would answer the District Courts concerns from the first go-round.  Having returned to the drawing table and taken new action, therefore, the Secretary was not subject to the charge of posthoc rationalization. Third, respondents invoke our decision in Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. ___ (2019), to contend that DHSs failure to hew[] to the administrative straight and narrow deprives the October 29 Memoranda of the presumption of regularity that normally attends agency action, Brief for Respondents 43.  As we explained in that case, in reviewing agency action, a court is ordinarily limited to evaluating the agencys contemporaneous explanation in light of the existing administrative record.  Department of Commerce, 588 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 23).  Department of Commerce involved a narrow exception to th[at] general rule that applies where the challengers to the agencys action make a strong showing of bad faith or improper behavior on the part of the agency.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 24) (quoting Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe,\n","\n","401 U.S. 402, 420 (1971)).  We held that exception satisfied by an accumulation of unusual circumstances that demonstrated an explanation for agency action that [was] incongruent with what the record reveal[ed] about the agencys priorities and decisionmaking process.  Department of Commerce, 588 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 28). The circumstances in this case do not come close to those in Department of Commerce.  Nothing in this record suggests a significant mismatch between the decision the Secretary made and the rationale he provided.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 26).  Respondents direct us instead to the Governments litigation conduct.  But the examples of misconduct to which respondents refersuch as a failure to timely complete the administrative record, Brief for Respondents 42have no bearing on the legal status of the October 29 Memoranda.  And in any event, they fall well short of the strong showing of bad faith or improper behavior, Overton Park, 401 U.S., at 420, that we require before deviating from our normal rule that [t]he grounds upon which an administrative order must be judged are those upon which the record discloses that its action was based, SEC v. Chenery Corp.,\n","\n","318 U.S. 80, 87 (1943). The Court of Appeals leveled the related but more modest charge that the Secretary failed to proceed with a sufficiently open mind.  See, e.g., 20 F. 4th, at 955 (agency proceeded without a hint of an intention to put the Termination Decision back on the chopping block and rethink things).  But the agencys ex ante preference for terminating MPPlike any other feature of an administrations policy agendashould not be held against the October 29 Memoranda.  It is hardly improper for an agency head to come into office with policy preferences and ideas ... and work with staff attorneys to substantiate the legal basis for a preferred policy.  Department of Commerce, 588 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 26); see also State Farm, 463 U.S., at 59 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (As long as [an] agency remains within the bounds established by Congress, it is entitled to assess administrative records and evaluate priorities in light of the philosophy of the administration. (footnote omitted)). And the critique is particularly weak on these facts.  The Court of Appeals took the agency to task for its September 29 announcement of its inten[tion] to issue in the coming weeks a new memorandum terminating MPP.  20 F. 4th, at 954; see ibid. (Rather than announcing an intention to reconsider its Termination Decision, the announcement set forth DHSs conclusion in unmistakable terms.).  But that announcement came over six weeks after the District Courts August 13 remanda substantial window of time for the agency to conduct a bona fide reconsideration. More importantly, this Court has previously rejected criticisms of agency closemindedness based on an identity between proposed and final agency action.  See Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 591 U.S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 24) (declin[ing] to evaluate the [agencys] final rules under [an] open-mindedness test where interim and final rules were virtually identical but procedural requirements were otherwise satisfied).  Similar principles refute the Court of Appeals criticism of the October 29 Memoranda for their failure to alter the Termination Decision in any way.  20 F. 4th, at 946.  It is black-letter law that an agency that takes superseding action on remand is entitled to reexamine[] the problem, recast its rationale and reach[] the same result.  Chenery II, 332 U.S., at 196; see also Regents, 591 U.S., at ___ (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (slip op., at 4) (Courts often consider an agencys ... additional explanations made ... on remand from a court, even if the agencys bottom-line decision itself does not change.). Finally, the Court of Appeals erred to the extent it viewed the Governments decision to appeal the District Courts injunction as relevant to the question of the October 29 Memorandas status as final agency action.  Nothing prevents an agency from undertaking new agency action while simultaneously appealing an adverse judgment against its original action.  That is particularly so under the circumstances of this case.  The second condition of the District Courts injunction, which purported to bind DHS to implement MPP in perpetuity subject only to congressional funding choices outside its control, as a practical matter left the Government no choice but to appeal.  And the agency reasonably chose to accede to the District Courts APA analysis of the June 1 Memorandum and seek to ameliorate those concerns in the meantime. *** For the reasons explained, the Governments rescission of MPP did not violate section 1225 of the INA, and the October 29 Memoranda did constitute final agency action.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  On remand, the District Court should consider in the first instance whether the October 29 Memoranda comply with section 706 of the APA.  See State Farm, 463 U.S., at 4657. It is so ordered. &&& SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21954 _________________ JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, etal., PETITIONERS v. TEXAS, etal. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit [June 30, 2022] Justice Kavanaugh, concurring. I agree with the Court that the District Court had jurisdiction over Texass suit.  I also agree with the Court that the Government prevails on the merits of the two specific legal questions presented here. I note, moreover, that six Members of the Court agree with the Courts merits conclusion.  See post, at 1 (Barrett, J., dissenting).   I write separately to briefly elaborate on my understanding of the relevant statutory provisions and to point out one legal issue that remains open for resolution on remand. When the Department of Homeland Security lacks sufficient capacity to detain noncitizens at the southern border pending their immigration proceedings (often asylum proceedings), the immigration laws afford DHS two primary options. Option one:  DHS may grant noncitizens parole into the United States if parole provides a significant public benefit.\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A). Parole entails releasing individuals on a case-by-case basis into the United States subject to reasonable assurances that they will appear at all hearings.  8 CFR 212.5(d) (2020); see\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A).  Notably, every Administration beginning in the late 1990s has relied heavily on the parole option, including the administrations of Presidents Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, 4954. Option two:  DHS may choose to return noncitizens to Mexico.\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C).  Consistent with that statutory authority, the prior Administration chose to return a relatively small group of noncitizens to Mexico.   In general, when there is insufficient detention capacity, both the parole option and the return-to-Mexico option are legally permissible options under the immigration statutes.  As the recent history illustrates, every President since the late 1990s has employed the parole option, and President Trump also employed the return-to-Mexico option for a relatively small group of noncitizens.  Because the immigration statutes afford substantial discretion to the Executive, different Presidents may exercise that discretion differently.  That is Administrative Law 101.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,\n","\n","463 U.S. 29, 59 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).   To be sure, the Administrative Procedure Act and this Courts decision in State Farm require that an executive agencys exercise of discretion be reasonable and reasonably explained.  See id., at 43 (majority opinion); see also FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. ___, ______, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 78, 11); FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.,\n","\n","556 U.S. 502, 514515 (2009);\n","\n","5 U.S.C. 706.  For example, when there is insufficient detention capacity and DHS chooses to parole noncitizens into the United States rather than returning them to Mexico, DHS must reasonably explain why parole provides a significant public benefit.\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A); see, e.g., State Farm, 463 U.S., at 4657.  Review under that State Farm standard is deferential but not toothless.  Id., at 56.  The question of whether DHSs October 29 decision satisfies the State Farm standard is not before this Court at this time.  The Court today therefore properly leaves the State Farm issue for consideration on remand.  See ante, at 18, 25; Tr. of Oral Arg. 6768. To be clear, when there is insufficient detention capacity and the President chooses the parole option because he determines that returning noncitizens to Mexico is not feasible for foreign-policy reasons, a court applying State Farm must be deferential to the Presidents Article II foreign-policy judgment.  Cf., e.g., Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. ___, ______ (2018) (slip op., at 1015).  Nothing in the relevant immigration statutes at issue here suggests that Congress wanted the Federal Judiciary to improperly second-guess the Presidents Article II judgment with respect to American foreign policy and foreign relations.  See Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,\n","\n","343 U.S. 579, 635637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring); see also Dames & Moore v. Regan,\n","\n","453 U.S. 654, 678679, 686688 (1981). One final note:  The larger policy story behind this case is the multi-decade inability of the political branches to provide DHS with sufficient facilities to detain noncitizens who seek to enter the United States pending their immigration proceedings.  But this Court has authority to address only the legal issues before us.  We do not have authority to end the legislative stalemate or to resolve the underlying policy problems.  With those additional comments, I join the Courts opinion in full. &&& SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21954 _________________ JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, etal., PETITIONERS v. TEXAS, etal. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit [June 30, 2022] Justice Barrett, with whom Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, and Justice Gorsuch join as to all but the first sentence, dissenting. I agree with the Courts analysis of the meritsbut not with its decision to reach them.  The lower courts in this case concluded that\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1252(f)(1), a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act sharply limiting federal courts jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of certain immigration laws, did not present a jurisdictional bar.  Just two weeks ago, however, we repudiated their reasoning in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. ___ (2022).  Because we are a court of review and not first view, I would vacate and remand for the lower courts to reconsider their assertion of jurisdiction in light of Aleman Gonzalez. *** Section 1252(f)(1) provides that no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of specified immigration provisions, except as applied to an individual alien against whom proceedings under [those provisions] have been initiated.  Some lower courts have narrowly interpreted this provision, holding that it does not bar relief that a plaintiff frames as requir[ing] (rather than preventing) the Governments enforcement of or compliance with the covered immigration laws.  E.g., 20 F.4th 928, 1004 (CA5 2021).  In this case, that was the only ground pressed by respondents below and relied on by the lower courts to hold that 1252(f)(1) did not ba[r] jurisdiction.  Ibid.; see App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a; Brief for Appellees in No. 2110806 (CA5), pp.4041.  But we just rejected this interpretation in Aleman Gonzalez.  There, we held that 1252(f)(1) deprives lower courts of jurisdiction to entertain requests for injunctions that order federal officials to take or to refrain from taking actions to enforce, implement, or otherwise carry out the specified statutory provisions (subject to an exception, indisputably inapplicable to this case, for a suit by an individual noncitizen in proceedings under those provisions).  596 U.S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 1, 5). In the normal course, we would vacate and remand this case for further proceedings in light of Aleman Gonzalez.  Instead, the Court plows ahead to break new jurisdictional ground.  Acting on a compressed timeline, it embraces a theory of 1252(f)(1) thatso far as I can tellno court of appeals has ever adopted: that 1252(f)(1) limits only the lower courts remedial authority, not their subject-matter jurisdiction.  The only court of appeals to have addressed this theory rejected it.  Miranda v. Garland, 34 F.4th 338, 354356 (CA4 2022).  Still, the Court is confident enough to proceed based on short, barely adversarial supplemental briefs.  (The United States original brief devoted only a conclusory footnote to the jurisdictional question, and Texas and Missouri did not respond.)  And these supplemental briefs are particularly unhelpful because, having been submitted prior to our decision in Aleman Gonzalez, they could not address that decisions significance for this case.  In fact, they devoted a considerable portion of their allotted length to the issue that Aleman Gonzalez subsequently resolved. This would all matter less if the jurisdictional question were easy or unimportantbut it is neither.  The Courts opinion papers over difficult issues, as I will discuss below, and its jurisdictional holding is likely to affect many cases.  See, e.g., Texas v. Biden, ___ F.Supp. 3d ___, ___, 2022 WL 658579, *14 (ND Tex., Mar. 4, 2022) (1252(f)(1) does not bar Texas claim that the Federal Government is wrongly refusing to detain noncitizens to determine if they have COVID19); Defendants Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion for Temporary Restraining Order 89 in Arizona v. CDC, Civ. No. 6:22cv00885 (WD La., Apr. 22, 2022) (arguing that 1252(f)(1) prohibits a district court from constraining the Federal Governments removal discretion in litigation challenging termination of Title 42 order).  We should not short circuit the ordinary process. I have several doubts about the Courts analysis of 1252(f)(1).  To begin with, the Court assumes that we face an either/or choice between subject-matter jurisdiction and remedial authority, with the former being only about a courts authority to decide merits questions and the latter being only about the relief a court can grant.  Ante, at 9.  This dichotomy makes the Courts job easier, because it can use the obvious point that 1252(f)(1) strips lower courts of remedial authority to establish that 1252(f)(1) does not strip them of subject-matter jurisdiction.  But why is it a binary choice?  I would think that Congress is free to link a courts subject-matter jurisdiction to its remedial authority.  That is not so different from an amount-in-controversy requirement, which conditions a district courts ability to address the merits on the relief that the plaintiff seeks.  See, e.g.,\n","\n","28 U.S.C. 1332 (district courts have subject-matter jurisdiction over diversity cases only when the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000).  And the redressability requirement of Article III itself establishes a tie between jurisdiction and remedies, because a courts inability to order effective relief deprives it of jurisdiction to decide the merits of a question otherwise within its competence.  See, e.g., California v. Texas, 593 U.S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 7) (redressability consider[s] the relationship between the judicial relief requested and the injury suffered); Los Angeles v. Lyons,\n","\n","461 U.S. 95, 105107 (1983) (failure to allege sufficient likelihood of future injury deprives a federal court of Article III jurisdiction to entertain [the count] of the complaint seeking injunctive relief). So it seems to me quite possible that 1252(f)(1) withdraws subject-matter jurisdiction over cases seeking certain remedies.  Indeed, while the Government has a theory for why the Court can reach the merits in this case, it characterizes 1252(f)(1) as imposing jurisdictional limitations that speak to a courts power and can never be forfeited or waived.  Supplemental Brief for Petitioners 1920; see also Miranda, 34 F.4th, at 354 (concluding that 1252(f)(1) is a jurisdiction-stripping statute that cannot be waived).  If there is a reason to treat limitations on  subject-matter jurisdiction and limitations on remedial authority as mutually exclusiveeither in general or in this statutory schemethe Court does not explain it. The Court breezes past other questions too.  Most notably, it gives surprisingly little attention to a phrase on which it places significant weight: 1252(f)(1)s parenthetical exempting the Supreme Court from its general bar on jurisdiction or authority.  The parties hardly discuss this parenthetical, which does not appear to have an analogue elsewhere in the United States Code.  The Court, however, takes the phrase as conclusive evidence that 1252(f)(1) does not deprive district courts of subject- matter jurisdiction over non-individual claims under [the covered provisions], because if it did, no such claims could ever arrive at this Court, rendering the provisions specific carveout for Supreme Court injunctive relief nugatory.  Ante, at 10. While this interpretation has some surface appeal, the Court does not explain how it would work.  Does it mean that the restriction on remedial authority is subject to waiver or forfeiture, so that a lower court can sometimes properly enter non-individual injunctive relief that this Court can then review?  That a district court has the authority to enter some kinds of non-individual relief (for example, a classwide declaratory judgment) and that this Court can enter different relief (for example, a classwide injunction) on review of that judgment?  Or that this Court can enter an injunction on appeal if the district court could have entered at least one form of relief, even if it actually entered only relief that exceeded its authority?[1]*  Or perhaps the parenthetical serves the very different purpose of clarifying that 1252(f)(1) does not disturb any pre-existing authority this Court has under the All Writs Act or other sources.  These are difficult questions, yet the Court does not address any of them. Indeed, the Court explicitly chooses not to opine on some of the issues that might help explain the parentheticals unusual reservation.  See ante, at 12, n.4.  For example, the Court declines to decide whether the bar in 1252(f)(1) is subject to forfeiture, even though that is a defining feature of nonjurisdictional rules.  See, e.g., Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Servs. of Chicago, 583 U.S. ___, ______ (2017) (slip op., at 23).  It reserves the question whether 1252(f)(1) bars declaratory relief, an issue on which there are conflicting views.  Compare Alli v. Decker, 650 F.3d 1007, 1013 (CA3 2011) (it does not bar declaratory relief), with id., at 10191021 (Fuentes, J., dissenting) (it does), with Hamama v. Adducci, 912 F.3d 869, 880, n.8 (CA6 2018) (it depends).  And it avoids a position on whether 1252(f)(1) prevents a lower court from vacating or setting aside an agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act.  See\n","\n","5 U.S.C. 706(2).  Not that I fault the Court for holding back.  Quite the contrary: The questions surrounding 1252(f)(1) are complex and deserve more attention than we can give them in this posture. As a final touch, the Court asserts that our precedent has already charted this course.  Ante, at 1112.  But the Court cannot muster much on that front.  It cites a passing statement rejecting an inapposite argument that 1252(f)(1) is a jurisdictional grant, see Reno v. American-Arab Anti- Discrimination Comm.,\n","\n","525 U.S. 471, 481 (1999), a brief discussion from a plurality opinion in a case where the 1252(f)(1) issue had not been briefed or argued by the parties in this Court, see Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. ___, ______ (2019) (slip op., at 89), and a dissent, see Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S ___, ___ (2018) (opinion of Breyer, J.) (slip op., at 31).  None provides a clear roadmap for this case. *** Given all this, I would tread more carefully.  We should let the lower courts be the first to address the substantial antecedent questions that 1252(f)(1) presents in light of our hot-off-the-presses decision in Aleman Gonzalez.  I respectfully dissent. &&& SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21954 _________________ JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, etal., PETITIONERS v. TEXAS, etal. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit [June 30, 2022] Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch join, dissenting. In fiscal year 2021, the Border Patrol reported more than 1.7 million encounters with aliens along the Mexican border.[1]  When it appears that one of these aliens is not admissible, may the Government simply release the alien in this country and hope that the alien will show up for the hearing at which his or her entitlement to remain will be decided? Congress has provided a clear answer to that question, and the answer is no.  By law, if an alien is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a [removal] proceeding.\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added).  And if an alien asserts a credible fear of persecution, he or she shall be detained for further consideration of the application for asylum, 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).  Those requirements, as we have held, are mandatory.  See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 13). Congress offered the Executive twoand only twoalternatives to detention.  First, if an alien is arriving on land from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may return the alien to that territory pending a [removal] proceeding.  1225(b)(2)(C).  Second, DHS may release individual aliens on parole, but only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit.  1182(d)(5)(A). Due to the huge numbers of aliens who attempt to enter illegally from Mexico, DHS does not have the capacity to detain all inadmissible aliens encountered at the border, and no one suggests that DHS must do the impossible.  But rather than avail itself of Congresss clear statutory alternative to return inadmissible aliens to Mexico while they await proceedings in this country, DHS has concluded that it may forgo that option altogether and instead simply release into this country untold numbers of aliens who are very likely to be removed if they show up for their removal hearings.  This practice violates the clear terms of the law, but the Court looks the other way. In doing so, the majority commits three main errors.  First, it unnecessarily resolves difficult jurisdictional questions on whichdue to the Governments litigation tacticswe have received only hurried briefing and no argument.  Second, when the majority reaches the merits, it contrives a way to overlook the clear statutory violations that result from DHSs decision to terminate the use of its contiguous-territory return authority.  Finally, the majority unjustifiably faults the Court of Appeals for rejecting the Governments last-minute attempt to derail the ordinary appellate process.  I cannot go along with any of this, and I therefore respectfully dissent. I In 2018, a surge of foreign migrants attempted to enter the United States unlawfully at the United States-Mexico border, creating a humanitarian and border security crisis.  554 F.Supp. 3d 818, 831 (ND Tex. 2021).  Because existing detention facilities could not house all the people who were attempting to enter unlawfully, many illegal aliens with meritless asylum claims were being released into the United States, and many, once released, simply disappeared. Ibid. (emphasis deleted).  To address this problem, DHS promulgated the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) in December of that year.  See id., at 832.  The MPP program relied on Congresss express grant of authority to return alien[s] ... arriving on land ... from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States to that territory pending a proceeding to remove them to their countries of origin.  1225(b)(2)(C).[2]  MPP provided that certain non-Mexican nationals arriving at the United States border by land from Mexico would be returned to Mexico to await the results of their removal proceedings.  The Mexican Government agreed to cooperate and to accept aliens while they awaited removal. While the policy was in effect, DHS issued a memorandum in which it determined that MPP was an indispensable tool in addressing the ongoing crisis at the southern border. App. 189 (Department of Homeland Security: Assessment of the Migrant Protection Protocols (Oct. 28, 2019)).  It concluded that MPP directly reduced the number of aliens unlawfully released into the United States and deterred others from attempting to cross the border unlawfully in the first place.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 833.  DHS found that total border encounters decreased by 64 percent after MPP was implemented.  App. 189.  With MPP in place, aliens who lacked meritorious claims could no longer count on a free ticket into the United States, and as a result, many voluntarily return[ed] home.  Id., at 192.  MPP also helped DHS process meritorious asylum claims within months, rather than leaving asylum applicants in limbo for years.  Id., at 190. Hours after his inauguration on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order suspending MPP, and the effects on the border were immediate.  According to the Governments own data, border encounters jump[ed] from 75,000 in January 2021, when MPP was first suspended, to about 173,000 in April 2021.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 837. Two States, Texas and Missouri, brought suit under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in April 2021, alleging that suspending MPP was arbitrary and capricious and violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).  The District Court ordered the Government to file the administrative record for the January suspension, and on May 31, 2021, the Government filed a three-line suspension memorandum as the entire administrative record.  See id., at 856, n. 16.  The next day, in a 7-page memo issued by the Secretary, DHS terminated the already-suspended program. The States amended their complaint to challenge the June termination decision on largely the same grounds that they had advanced with respect to the January suspension.  After a consolidated preliminary injunction hearing and a trial on the merits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2), the District Court vacated the Governments decision to rescind MPP and enjoined the Secretary to continue to implement that policy in good faith until all the aliens in question could be detained or lawfully paroled.  Id., at 857.  The Government sought a stay of this order, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, while expediting the Governments appeal, refused to issue a stay.  10 F. 4th 538, 543561 (2021) (percuriam).  The Government then sought a stay in this Court, but we denied that application.  594 U.S. ___ (2021). On September 29, 2021, while briefing in the Court of Appeals was underway, DHS announced that it intended to issue a new memorandum terminating MPP, and the Government asked the Court of Appeals to hold its appeal in abeyance pending this promised administrative action.  App. 5152.  The Court of Appeals denied that motion, id., at 54, and then, two business days before oral argument, DHS issued two memoranda declaring that DHS had made a new decision terminating MPP.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 257a345a.  At the same time, the Government asked the Court of Appeals to hold that the case before it was moot, to vacate the District Courts judgment and injunction, and to remand the case for further proceedings.  20 F. 4th 928, 946 (CA5 2021).  The Fifth Circuit refused and held that the October 29 Memoranda did not moot the appeal or have any other legal effect on the appellate proceedings.  Id., at 956966, 9981000.  The Fifth Circuit then affirmed the District Court on the merits. II I agree with the majority that the injunction entered by the District Court in this case exceeded its jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the relevant statutes.  1252(f)(1).  That conclusion follows from a straightforward analysis of the text of 1252(f)(1), as recognized by the Courts decision in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. ___ (2022).  But that is where the majority and I part ways. I agree with Justice Barrett that the majority should not go any further and should not resolve other questions about 1252(f)(1) without adequate briefing or argument.  The Government admits that this Court could in theory vacate the judgment below without reaching the merits, Supp. Brief for Petitioners 23, but the majority chooses to decide far more than is necessary or advisable under the circumstances. As Justice Barrett explains, the interpretation of 1252(f)(1) presents difficult questions that the parties should have addressed in the briefs they filed before oral argument.  In its opening brief, the Governments only discussion of this issue appeared in a footnote that reads as follows in its entirety: In addition, the lower courts lacked jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief under 8 U.S.C. []1252(f)(1). This Court is considering the scope of Section 1252(f)(1) in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, No. 20322 (argued Jan. 11, 2022).  Brief for Petitioners 18, n. 3. That footnotes reference to the Governments brief in Gonzalez raised an obvious question.  Section 1252(f)(1) refers to orders that enjoin or restrain the operation of specified statutory provisions, and in Gonzalez, the Government suggested that this provision should not be interpreted to apply only to injunctions.  Brief for Petitioners 1719, 32, n. 3, and Tr. of Oral Arg. 1516, in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, O. T. 2021, No. 20322.  Instead, the Government refused to rule out the possibility that the provision might also apply to class-wide declaratory relief, and it analogized 1252(f)(1) to the Tax Injunction Act,\n","\n","28 U.S.C. 1341, and cited our decision in California v. Grace Brethren Church,\n","\n","457 U.S. 393 (1982), which interpreted that provision in a practical sense.  Id., at 408. In the present case, the Government challenged the order of the District Court set[ting] aside under the APA,\n","\n","5 U.S.C. 706(2), the June termination of MPP, and since this order had a practical effect that was in some respects similar to an injunction, the Governments argument in Gonzalez raised the question whether the Government thought that 1252(f)(1) also barred the District Court from reviewing the termination of the MPP under the APA.  That is an important question the resolution of which could have effects extending far beyond this particular dispute, and at oral argument the Solicitor General took the far-reaching position that 1252(f)(1) does indeed bar APA review.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 1314.  But none of the papers filed by the Government in this case or in Gonzalez said one word about APA review.  Nor did the respondents brief.  Indeed, their brief did not discuss jurisdiction at all. Faced with this situation, the Court was correctly concerned about deciding the reach of 1252(f)(1) and the important APA question without any briefing.  The Court could haveand, in my judgment, should havedealt with this problem by deciding this case without saying anything about 1252(f)(1) other than that it bars injunctive relief.  Instead, with the end of the Term looming ahead, the Court directed the parties to brief these issues, but it gave them just one week to do so.  And as the Court should have anticipated, those briefs raised new questions that it would have been useful to explore at argument had that been held.  But determined to accommodate the Governments request that this case be decided this Term, the majority inadvisably plows ahead. I would not do so.  Because of the Governments request for a speedy decision, we established an expedited schedule for the filing of merits briefs and squeezed in oral argument on the next-to-last argument date.  We would have been in a position to give thorough consideration to the 1252(f)(1) issue if it had been addressed in the parties regular briefs, but having relegated the issue to a terse footnote in its brief, and having been unprepared to discuss the issue at argument, the Government is not entitled to any further special treatment.  We should simply vacate the decision below and remand for reconsideration in light of our decision in Gonzalez.[3]  Nothing more is either necessary or appropriate under the circumstances. III The Court is not only wrong to reach the merits of this case, but its analysis of the merits is seriously flawed.  First, the majority errs in holding that the INA does not really mean what it says when it commands that the aliens in question shall be detained pending removal or asylum proceedings unless they are either returned to Mexico or paroled on a case-by-case basis.  According to the majority, it is fine for DHS simply to release these aliens en masse and allow them to disappear.  Second, the majority improperly faults the Court of Appeals for refusing to allow the Government to derail the appellate process by a last-minute maneuver designed to thwart review of the manner in which it initially terminated MPP. A As described above, the INA gives DHS three options regarding the treatment of the aliens in question while they await removal or asylum proceedings.  They may be (1) detained in this country or (2) returned to Mexico or (3) paroled on a case-by-case basis.  Congress has provided no fourth option, but the majority now creates one.  According to the majority, an alien who cannot be detained due to a shortage of detention facilities but could be returned to Mexico may simply be released.  That is wrong. 1 The language of\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(A) is unequivocal.  With narrow exceptions that are inapplicable here,[4] it provides that every alien who is an applicant for admission and who the examining immigration officer determines ... is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted ... shall be detained for a [removal] proceeding.  (Emphasis added.)  Six years ago, the Government argued strenuously that this requirement is mandatory, and its brief could hardly have been more categorical or emphatic in making this point.  See Brief for Petitioners in Jennings v. Rodriguez, O. T. 2017, No. 151204, p. 15 (Aliens seeking admission who are not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted are statutorily prohibited from physically entering the United States and must be detained during removal proceedings ... , unless the Secretary exercises his discretion to release them on parole); id., at 17 (Unlike the word may, which implies discretion, the word shall usually connotes a requirement.  And here, the repeated shall be detained clearly means what it says (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). The Jennings Court correctly accepted that argument, which was central to our holding.  See 583 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (Read most naturally, 1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) thus mandate detention of applicants for admission until certain proceedings have concluded).  But now, in an about-face, the Government argues that shall be detained actually means may be detained.  See Brief for Petitioners 29 ([T]he Court will not construe a provision stating that law enforcement shall take some action as a true mandate absent some stronger indication from the ... Legislature). The Government was correct in Jennings and is wrong here.  [S]hall be detained means shall be detained.  The Government points out that it lacks the facilities to detain all the aliens in question, and no one questions that fact.  But use of the contiguous-return authority would at least reduce the number of aliens who are released in violation of the INAs command.  The District Court made a factual finding that rescinding MPP would cause additional violations of Congresss unambiguous detention mandate.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 851852.  It also found that the termination of MPP has contributed to the current border surge by giving aliens the perverse incentiv[e], id., at 837, App. 196, to cross the border illegally in hopes of being paroled and released.  Id., at 79.  Thus, the Government is failing to meet the statutory detention mandate, not only because of limitations on its detention capacity but also because it refuses to use the contiguous-territory return authority. Other than the argument that shall means may, the Governments only other textual argument is that it is paroling aliens on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit, as permitted under 1182(d)(5)(A).  But the number of aliens paroled each month under that provisionmore than 27,000 in April of this year[5]gives rise to a strong inference that the Government is not really making these decisions on a case-by-case basis.  The Government argues that respondents had the burden to show that it is not making case-by-case determinations and that they have not met that burden, see Brief for Petitioners 34, but information about the true nature of these proceedings is in the Governments possession, and it has revealed little about what actually takes place.  At argument, however, the Solicitor General argued that the case-by-case determination requirement can be met simply by going through a brief checklist for each alien.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5860.  Even the rudimentary step of verifying that an alien does not have a criminal record is not performed in every case.  Id., at 31.  Such procedures are inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of case-by-case review, and as the Court of Appeals pointed out, the circumstances under which 1182(d)(5)(B)) was adopted bolster that conclusion.  See 20 F. 4th, at 947 (After the executive branch on multiple occasions purported to use the parole power to bring in large groups of immigrants, Congress twice amended\n","\n","8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5) to limit the scope of the parole power and prevent the executive branch from using it as a programmatic policy tool (citing T. Aleinikoff etal., Immigration and Citizenship: Process and Policy 300 (9th ed. 2021))). The majority claims that the Governments use of its parole authority under 1182(d)(5)(A) is not before us, ante, at 18, but the Government cites that authority as a reason why it does not need to use its contiguous-territory return authority.  Brief for Petitioners 6, 3336. Moreover, the District Courts judgment relied on factual findings regarding DHSs abuse of its parole authority on the record that the Government provided.  554 F.Supp. 3d, at 837. For these reasons, 1182(d)(5)(A) cannot justify the release of tens of thousands of apparently inadmissible aliens each month, and that leaves the Government with only one lawful option: continue to return inadmissible aliens to Mexico.  See 1225(b)(2)(C). 2 The majoritys chief defense of the Governments rejection of MPP is based on a blinkered method of statutory interpretation that we have firmly rejected.  The majority largely ignores the mandatory detention requirement imposed by 1225(b)(2)(A) and, instead, reads the contiguous-return provision, 1225(b)(2)(C), in isolation.  That provision says that the Secretary may return aliens to the country from which they entered, not that the Secretary must do so, and for the majority, that is enough to show that use of that authority is not required. That reading ignores the statutory structure of the INA, ante, at 14, and wrongly confine[s] itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation.  FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,\n","\n","529 U.S. 120, 132 (2000).  We have an obligation to read the INA as a coherent regulatory scheme.  Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,\n","\n","513 U.S. 561, 569 (1995); see also FTC v. Mandel Brothers, Inc.,\n","\n","359 U.S. 385, 389 (1959); Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U.S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 10); A. Scalia & G. Garner, Reading Law 180 (2012) (describing the harmonious-reading canon).  And if we follow that canon, the majoritys interpretation collapses. Read as a whole, the INA gives DHS discretion to choose from among only three options for handling the relevant category of inadmissible aliens.  The Government must either: (1) detain them, (2) return them to a contiguous foreign nation, or (3) parole them into the United States on an individualized, case-by-case basis.  These options operate in a hydraulic relationship: When it is not possible for the Government to comply with the statutory mandate to detain inadmissible aliens pending further proceedings, it must resort to one or both of the other two options in order to comply with the detention requirement to the greatest extent possible. There is nothing strange about this interpretation of how the relevant provisions of the INA work together.  Consider this example.  Suppose a state law provides that every school district shall provide a free public education to every student from kindergarten through the 12th grade and that another statute says that a district may arrange for its students to attend high school in an adjacent district.  A small district refuses to operate its own high school because it lacks the necessary funds, and this district also declines to arrange for its students to attend a school in an adjacent district because the law says only that a district may take that course of action.  Refusing to exercise this discretionary authority, the district throws up its hands and says to its high school students: Were sorry.  If you want to go to high school, you will have to make your own arrangements and foot the bill.  If those students sue, would any court sustain what the district did? Other examples come readily to mind.  Suppose that a building code says that every multi-unit residential building shall have at least two means of egress from upper floors, and suppose that another provision says that such a building may have an external fire escape.  The owner of such a building refuses to construct a second internal stairway because the cost would be prohibitive and also declines to install a fire escape because the law says that option is discretionary.  Would the owners non-compliance be permitted? Here is one more example.  A State that operates its own motor vehicle inspection facilities has a law that says that every vehicle shall be inspected every year.  The law also says that motorists may have their vehicles inspected at a licensed private garage.  A motorist fails to have his car inspected because he must work during the time when the state facility is open and would be fired if he took time off.  This motorist also declines to have his car inspected at a private garage that is open during his off hours because the law says only that he may use such a facility.  Would the motorist escape a citation? The answer in each of the above examples is that the failure to make use of the discretionary option would not be seen as a valid excuse for non-compliance with the command that certain conduct shall be performed, and it is also hard to see the difference between those examples and the situation here. 3 The majoritys main reason for rejecting the argument just described is that the contiguous-return provision does not say expressly that it was meant to operate as a mandatory cure of any non-compliance with the Governments detention obligations.  Ante, at 14.  But what logic compels need not be stated expressly. The majority also relies on the fact that the contiguous- return provision was enacted 90 years after the provision requiring detention and the fact that the circumstances under which the contiguous-return provision was adopted suggest that it was intended to serve only a humble role.  Ante, at 16.  Those circumstances cannot change what the relevant provisions say or the way in which they logically work together.  See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc.,\n","\n","545 U.S. 546, 568 (2005) (Extrinsic materials have a role in statutory interpretation only to the extent that they shed a reliable light on the enacting Legislatures understanding of otherwise ambiguous terms).  The Court should not use extra-textual evidence to demote one of DHSs three lawful alternatives to the status of a historical footnote. The majority and the concurrence fault the lower courts for intruding upon the foreign policy authority conferred on the President by Article II of the Constitution.  Ante, at 1617 (majority opinion); ante, at 3 (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.).  But enforcement of immigration laws often has foreign relations implications, and the Constitution gives Congress broad authority to set immigration policy.  See Art. I, 8, cl. 4.  This means, we have said, that [p]olicies pertaining to the entry of aliens are entrusted exclusively to Congress.  Galvan v. Press,\n","\n","347 U.S. 522, 531 (1954) (emphasis added).  The President has vital power in the field of foreign affairs, so does Congress, and the President does not have the authority to override immigration laws enacted by Congress.  Indeed, [w]hen the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter.  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,\n","\n","343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).  And it is Congress, not the Judiciary, that gave the Executive only three options for dealing with inadmissible aliens encountered at the border. Finally, the majority emphasizes the fact that prior administrations have also failed to detain inadmissible aliens, but that practice does not change what the law demands.  The majority cites no authority for the doctrine that the Executive can acquire authority forbidden by law through a process akin to adverse possession. B Not only does the majority fail to heed the clear language of the INA, but it gratuitously faults the Court of Appeals for what appears to be a fairly modest and correct conclusion: that the October 29 Memoranda purporting to re-terminate MPP did not ultimately affect the merits of the appeal of the judgment that was before that court.  The Government issued its October 29 Memoranda after briefing in the Court of Appeals had been completed and only days before the appeal was set to be argued.  Based on those memoranda, the Government asked the Court of Appeals to vacate the judgment below, but it did not provide a full administrative record or give the District Court an opportunity to review the purported new decision in the first instance by filing a Rule 60(b) motion.[6]  The majority now says that the Court of Appeals erred by failing to treat the October 29 Memoranda as a new, final agency action, but the majority does not say what applying that label would have required the Fifth Circuit to do differently. As I see it, the Governments litigation tacticfiling the October 29 Memoranda with a suggestion of mootness but without seeking to dismiss its appealcould have triggered one of four responses from the Court of Appeals.  The Court of Appeals could have (1) dismissed the appeal as moot and vacated the District Courts judgment and injunction; (2) held the appeal in abeyance for an unspecified time; (3) evaluated the October 29 Memoranda as final agency action in the first instance under the APA; or (4) concluded that the October 29 Memoranda did not affect the appeal, which challenged the June termination.  The Court of Appeals picked the fourth option, and taking each option in turn, I will explain why that was the response best suited to avoid derailing the ordinary appellate process. First, the October 29 Memoranda did not moot the appeal.  A case becomes moot only if it is impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief.  Chafin v. Chafin,\n","\n","568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013).  Under this high standard, the Fifth Circuit was correct that the case was not moot.  Although the Government claimed that the appeal was moot, it asked the Court of Appeals for relief, namely, vacatur of District Courts injunction.  It was compelled to take that position because the October 29 Memoranda, by their own terms, did not take effect as long as that injunction remained in force.  See 20 F. 4th, at 957.  And without an appellate decision holding that the INA allows the Government to release aliens who could be returned to Mexico, the issuance of a new administrative order terminating MPP could not provide a ground for vacating the injunction.  It is telling that the Governments briefing in this Court never suggests that the case was moot at the time of the Fifth Circuits decision or that the case is now moot. Second, the Court of Appeals did not err by declining to hold the appeal in abeyance.  The Government originally asked the Court of Appeals to hold the appeal while it completed the process of issuing a new termination decision, but by the time of oral argument in that court, the Government claimed that such a decision had been issued.  And the Government did not file a motion in the District Court to vacate its judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b).  The Government had sought to expedite proceedings at every stage, including by seeking emergency relief in the Fifth Circuit and this Court, and under these circumstances, it was eminently reasonable for the Court of Appeals to conclude that additional delay would not have served the interests of economy of time and effort.  Landis v. North American Co.,\n","\n","299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936). Third, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the October 29 Memoranda could not satisfy our criteria for a final agency action that could be reviewed in the first instance in the Court of Appeals under the APA.  Like this Court, the courts of appeal are courts of review, and not first view.  City of Austin v. Reagan Nat. Advertising of Austin, LLC, 596 U.S. ___, ______ (2022) (slip op., at 1314) (quoting Zivotofsky v. Clinton,\n","\n","566 U.S. 189, 201 (2012)).  With no administrative record for the October 29 Memoranda before it, the Court of Appeals was in a poor position to assess whether the memoranda actually mark[ed] the consummation of the agencys decisionmaking process, Bennett v. Spear,\n","\n","520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Moreover, the October 29 Memoranda did not purport to result in a final determination of rights or obligations.  Ibid.  As DHS acknowledged, the termination of MPP could not be implemented until there was a final judicial decision to vacate the ... injunction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 264a, 270a.  And until that was accomplished, the memoranda did not impose on DHS officers or employees any obligatio[n] to cease implementation of MPP.  Bennett, 520 U.S., at 178.  On this basis, the Fifth Circuit rightly understood that the October 29 Memoranda could have no legal effect while DHS was bound by an injunction to implement MPP in good faith and that this injunction would remain in force unless the Governments challenge to the June termination was decided in its favor.[7] Even if the Fifth Circuit had somehow concluded that the October 29 Memoranda constituted final agency action with some future legal consequences, the Court does not explain what the Fifth Circuit should have done differently in the circumstances it faced.  The Fifth Circuit had little ability to review whether the agency had acted reasonably.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,\n","\n","463 U.S. 29 (1983).  And the Fifth Circuit provided a reasonable explanation for its actions. With these three options off the table, the Fifth Circuit reasonably chose the fourth option.  It correctly concluded that the October 29 Memoranda did not affect its ability to review the District Court judgment.  To find fault with proceeding in that fashion, the majority seems to assume that an administrative agency may obviate a district court decision setting aside agency action under 706 of the APA by pursing the following course of conduct: first, appeal the district court decision; second, take a purportedly new action that achieves the same result as the one previously set aside; and third, while declining to seek vacatur of the earlier judgment in the district court, ask the court of appeals to vacate that judgment without reviewing its correctness or the lawfulness of the second action.  The Court of Appeals was correct to view this as an effort to thwart the normal appellate process. *** While I would affirm the Fifth Circuit if we reached the merits, I agree with the majority that the District Court on remand should consider in the first instance whether the October 29 Memoranda complied with 706 of the APA.  The District Court should assess, among other things, whether it is arbitrary and capricious for DHS to refuse to use its contiguous-territory return authority to avoid violations of the statutes clear detention mandate; whether the deterrent effect that DHS found MPP produced in reducing dangerous attempted illegal border crossings, as well as MPPs reduction of unmeritorious asylum claims, is adequately accounted for in the agencys new decision; and whether DHSs rescission of MPP is causing it to make parole decisions on an unlawful categorical basis rather than case-by-case, as the statute prescribes.\n","\n","tokenized_text: tensor([[24710,   151, 15934,  ...,   107,   240,     1]]) 1024\n","\n","summary_ids: tensor([[    0,   139,  1462,   211,  7111,   120, 42817,   110, 47340,   192,\n","         18204,   109,   125, 10913,   108, 12490,   120,  1201,   665,  5247,\n","           113,   109,   125, 10913,   592,   109,   657,   228,   671,   122,\n","          2132,   112,  4383, 25698,   151,  7672, 15250, 17154,   112,  1201,\n","           665,  5247,   741,  1271, 95855,   251,   158,   132, 39909,   121,\n","           144, 63493, 27008,   935, 17154,   112,  1201,   665,  5247,   741,\n","          1271, 95855,   529,   250,  2110,   109,  2506,   140,  3231,   112,\n","           670,   203,  7672, 15250,  7600,   365,  1201,   665,  5247,   741,\n","          1271, 95855,   251,   158,   640,   112,  2478, 10626,   108,   109,\n","          1462, 45356,   108, 42817,   110, 47340,   192,  4213,   756,   112,\n","           109, 16673,  7826,   113,  1201,   665,  5247,   130,  4383, 25698,\n","           195,  1291,   190,   109,   706,  1013,   107,     1]]) 118\n","\n","pred: The court first concluded that terminating MPP would violate the INA, reasoning that section 1225 of the INA provides the government two options with respect to illegal entrants: mandatory detention pursuant to section 1225(b)(2)(A) or contiguous-territory return pursuant to section 1225(b)(2)(C).

The Fifth Circuit affirmed an order enjoining the termination of MMP.The Supreme Court reversed.   The rescission of MPP did not violate INA section 1225.  The contiguous-territory return authority in section 1225(b)(2)(C) is discretionary and remains discretionary notwithstanding any violation of section 1225(b)(2)(A), which provides for mandatory detention of such aliens.  Since its enactment, every Presidential administration has interpreted section 1225(b)(2)(C) as discretionary, notwithstanding the consistent shortfall of funds to comply with section 1225(b)(2)(A). Interpreting section 1225(b)(2)(C) as a mandate imposes a significant burden upon the Executive’s ability to conduct diplomatic relations with Mexico. The availability of parole as an alternative means of processing applicants for admission (section 1182(d)(5)(A)), additionally makes clear that the Court of Appeals erred.
